With the advent of World War II, the Silber family moved to America, settling in the Bronx. He learned in RJJ, Torah Vodaas and Yeshivas Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin. He also served as National Director of Pirchei Agudas Yisrael. In 1946, Reb Meilech was sent by Rav Hutner to a new yeshiva in the Crown Heights neighborhood which was searching for a principal. At the time, the yeshiva consisted of 10 kindergartners and two teachers. From this humble beginning grew the renowned Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway. Throughout the next 25 years, Reb Meilech built the yeshiva into a dynamic force in Torah education. Today, the yeshiva is known as Yeshiva Zichron Meilech.</span></h2>",

Abrabanel was born in Lisbon, Portugal, to an illustrious Sephardic family which traced its lineage back to Dovid Hamelech. His grandfather, Rav Shmuel, escaped from Seville, Spain, when the Catolics destroyed the Jewish quarter, mudering many Jews. When Rav Yitzchak was only 20, he completed his first book, Ateres Zekeinim, and began to work on his famous commentary on the Torah. In the Summer of 1471, following the victory of King Alfonso V over Morocco, an emissary of the Moroccan Jewish community, Emmanuel ben Yitzchak, approached Don Yitzchak Abrabanel with a plea to assist in the ransom of 250 Jewish would-be slaves. The Abarbavnl was not only successful, he added his own funds to supply food and medicine. Abarbanel served as treasurer to King Alfonso until he was forced to move to Castile (Spain) and eventually entered the service of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1484. In March 1492, an edict was issued expelling the Jews from Spain, after the conquest of Granade. Despite his political influence he was unable to prevent the expulsion in 1492 and refused the king&rsquo;s offer to remain at his post, choosing instead to throw in his lot with his people. On Tisha B&rsquo;Av, he led 300,000 Jews out of the country. Only 10% reached safe shores. Rav Yitzchak found asylum in Naples, where he remained for seven years, until the French invaded. He then fled to Corfu and finally &ndash; in 1503 - to Venice, where he died. Most of his writings were composed in his later years when he was free of governmental responsibilities.</span></h2>",

Born in Livorno, Italy, of Sephardic descent, he traced his lineage back to the exiles from the Spanish Expulsion. When he was still a young child his family resettled in England. Young Moses became a member of the London Stock Exchange at a time when there were only 12 licensed Jewish brokers in all of England. In a matter of a few years he had amassed great wealth and had become a member of the London Aristocracy. In 1812, he married his wife Judith, whose sister was the wife of Reb Nathan Meyer Rothschild, one of the wealthiest Jews in Europe at the time. Sir Moses eventually became the stockbroker for his brother-in-law and as a result of their partnership they amassed a tremendous fortune. In addition, he was a partner in a large insurance company as well as a gas company that introduced gas lighting to many of the major cities of Europe. Sir Moses also had a hand in building railroads and many other industrial and financial enterprises. As the years passed, Moses and Judith grew together in their Yiddishkeit. In 1837, Montefiore was appointed Sheriff of London. In the same year, Queen Victoria, who had recently ascended the British Throne, awarded him the honorary title of Knighthood, bestowing upon him the title &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; Moses. In 1846, he was elevated to the rank of Baron. By the time he was 41 years old, Sir Moses retired from business affairs and devoted the rest of his life to Jewish affairs. When he was appointed as Sheriff of London, he specifically wrote in his contract that he would be absolved from working on Shabbos and Yom Tov. He also specified that he was to be absolved from entering a Church on non-Jewish holidays. Even when he was traveling, he almost always made sure to travel with an entourage of at least 10 Jews to ensure that he would have a minyan. He also took one of the many sifrei Torah that he owned along with him. In 1840, a monk named Thomas disappeared from his home several weeks before Pesach. The French Counsel in Damascus blamed the Jews for his disappearance and claimed that they killed the monk to use his blood for matzos. Prominent Damascus Jews were imprisoned and tortured. Many died and some, who could not withstand the torture, &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; under duress to the crime. Upon learning of it, Sir Moses traveled to Damascus to save the country and the honor of the Jewish people. In 1846, Sir Moses was invited by the Russian government to visit Russia in connection with its Jewish situation. Upon returning to London, he demanded equal rights for the Jews and stressed that it would also be an economic blessing for the country. Montefiore&rsquo;s 100th birthday was celebrated as an official holiday in London and he was accorded great honor by both Jew and non-Jew alike. The Montefiores died childless, but they left behind a legacy of tzedaka and chesed that endures to this very day.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Shortly afterwards, he was invited to serve as Rav of Volozhin (where he authored Shaagas Aryeh), and later in Metz, Germany. Prior to his petirah, the Shaagas Aryeh made a siyum of Shas, which he had reviewed one thousand times during his lifetime.

Thirty of his works in the area of halacha have been published. His works included Urim V'tumim, Kereisi Ufleisi, Yaaros Dvash, and Ahavas Yehonasan (a commentary on the weekly haftorahs). During his lifetime, there were a large number of mothers who dies during childbirth, along with their babies. Rav Yehonasn wrote amulets (kameyos) for women about to give birth in effort to stop this scourge. There is evidence that they worked: In the cemetery in Altoona, there quite a few gravestones with the words &ldquo;mother and newborn child.&rdquo; These appeared to stop at the time of the writing of the kameyos. Nonetheless, these kameyos were cited by Rav Yaakov Emden as &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; that Rav Yehonasan was a follower of Shabtai Tzvi, fueling a controversy that raged for decades. Interestingly, the two great Torah leaders are buried only a few spaces apart in Altoona when the matter was deemed to be l&rsquo;shem shamayaim.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

The Maharal married at the age of 32 to Pearl. He had six girls and one boy who was named after the Maharal's father, Betzalel. In 1553 he was elected rabbi of Nikolsburg and the Province of Moravia, where he remained for the following 20 years. In 1573 he moved to Prague, where he opened a yeshiva. In 1592 the Maharal accepted the position of rabbi in Posen, returning to Prague in 1598 to serve as its chief rabbi. The Maharal castigated the educational methods of his day where boys were taught at a very young age and insisted that children must be taught in accordance with their intellectual maturity. One of his leading disciples was R. Yom Tov Heller, author of the classic mishnaic commentary, Tosafos Yom Tov, who, in his introduction informs us that the Maharal greatly encouraged group study of the Mishna. At the same time, he was fully conversant with the scientific knowledge of his time as well as friendly with some of the contemporary eminent scientists. His disciple, Dovid Ganz, worked in the observatory of Tycho Brahe, the distinguished astronomer. He was a prolific writer, and his works include: Tiferes Yisrael on the greatness of Torah and mitzvos; Nesivos Olam, on ethics; Be'er Hagolah, a commentary on rabbinic sayings; Netzach Yisrael, on exile and redemption; Or Chadash, on the book of Esther; Ner Mitzvah, on Chanukah; Gevuros Hashem, on the Exodus; and many others.

His younger brother, Rav Yehuda, who would marry Rav Yaakov&rsquo;s daughter, succeeded the Rosh as Rav of Toledo, while Rav Yaakov himself preferred to take a position on the Beis Din. His monumental halchic work, the Arba&rsquo;ah Turim included virtually all opinions available to Rav Yaakov, as well as a wealth of customs. The many commentators on the Tur include those of Rav Yosef Karo (the Beis Yosef), Rav Moshe Isserles (Darkei Moshe), Rav Yoel Sirkes (The Beis Chadash), Rav Yehoshua Falk (Derishah uPerishah), and Rav Yosef Escapa (the Rosh Yosef), who deals with only a part of the work. The Chida comments that without a proper study of the Tur and its commentaries, one cannot begin to determine halachah.

Born in Latvia of staunch Chassidic and Misnagid stock, he retained throughout his life a unique blend of the mystical and the rational. He was a thorough master of the entire Halachic, Midrashic, philosophic, ethical, and Kabbalistic literature. He saw the return to Eretz Yisrael as not merely a political phenomenon to save Jews from persecution, but an event of extraordinary historical and theological significance. Rabbi Hutner once said that Rav Kook peered down on our world from great heights and hence his perspective was unique. Above all, Rav Kook pulsated with a sense of the Divine. Though keenly aware of the huge numbers of non-observant Jews, he had a vision of the repentance of the nation. His concept of repentance envisioned in addition to the repentance of the individual, a repentance of the nation as a whole; a repentance which would be joyous and healing. He refused to reject Jews as long as they identified themselves as Jews. He called for and envisioned a spiritual renaissance where \"the ancient would be renewed and the new would be sanctified.\"</span></h2>",

Known as the Sheva-Chaim of Sanz, he was a great-grandson of the Divrei Chaim of Sanz. He spent most of World War II in concentration camps. During his last 15 years of life, he founded Kollelei Shas in Eretz Yisrael and America. These Kollelei Shas were intended for premier avreichim who were already known for their sharp intellect and hasmada. The goal of the kollel was that in the course of three years, the members had to complete the entire Shas. Every member had to obligate himself to be tested on 75 blatt Gemara with Tosafos each month and know them by heart! Then, in 1983, at his house in Kiryat Sanz, Netanya, he laid the cornerstone for what would ultimately become Mifal HaShas, where avreichim would learn 30 blatt of Gemara with Tosafos with a built-in review program and be tested monthly on the material learned. In addition to his tremendous efforts on behalf of Torah learning, the Rebbe also used his experiences from the war to stimulate him in another area. Having survived the horror of witnessing the murder of his wife and their 11 children, Reb Yekusiel vowed to dedicate his life to welfare and good health of all Jewish children. He founded Laniado Hospital in Netanya in 1975 after 15 years of fund-raising. His vision of a proper Jewish hospital was confirmed in 1990, as it was one of the only hospitals in Israel to have every employee working during the 127-day doctors&rsquo; strike. After his petira, his eldest surviving son, Rav Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, became the new Sanz Rebbe in Israel, as well as President of the Hospital.</span></h2>",

In 1925, Rav Hofstein led a group of chassidim that made aliyah, and together with followers of Rav Taub of Kozmark, Czechoslovakia, established a new community called Kfar Chassidim. Rav Hofstein himself took ill and was forced to leave Eretz Yisrael.&nbsp; He moved to Paris, where he was named Chief Rabbi of the chareidi community.&nbsp; When the Germans invaded Paris, Rav Hofstein was arrested, but he escaped.&nbsp; In 1941, he reached the United States. In 1966, he established a Kozhnitzer Beis Midrash in Tel Aviv. Rav Hofstein's Torah commentaries were published by his chassidim under the title Avodas Elazar.

At the age of 16 Aryeh was sent to study under Rav Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler and became his talmid muvhak. Rav Carmell began to compile Rav Dessler's teachings under his guidance. After the war he married, making his home in London. He would spend the morning hours learning bechavrusa with some of London's leading rabbanim. In the afternoon he would go to his office to work for a few hours, setting aside time every day to organize chessed and outreach activities. He was among the first to become involved in Jewish outreach over 50 years ago. Following Rav Dessler's petirah he started Yad Eliyahu in London, where children who studied at public schools were taught ahavas Torah and yiras Shomayim. He published Michtav MeEliyohu, a compilation of Rav Dessler's teachings. The first three volumes were edited with Rav Alter Halperin and Rav Chaim Friedlander, while Rav Carmell edited the fourth and fifth volumes by himself. He also adapted parts of the work into a book in English called Strive for Truth. He also co-edited Challenge: Torah Views on Science and its Problems and wrote an important booklet called Aid to Talmud Study. When the wave of Russian aliya began he wrote a book called Masterplan. Based on Rav Shamshon Raphael Hirsch's Chorev, it also presented reasons behind the mitzvos. Moving to Eretz Yisrael in 1972, Carmell settled in Jerusalem's Bayit Vegan neighborhood and helped Rav Boruch Horowitz found Yeshivas Dvar Yerushalayim, Jerusalem's first yeshiva for baalei teshuvoh. He gave shiurim on gemora, hashkofoh and Mussar.</span></h2>",

By stressing the overriding importance of in-depth Torah study, the Belzer Rebbe removed the stigma of superficiality that had plagued Chasidism. He was succeeded by his son, Rav Yehoshua. In the 1940s, the Nazis all but wiped out the splendor that was Belz.

When he was thirteen, his parents moved to Eretz Yisrael, and made their home in Balfouria, a small settlement in the Valley of Jezreel. He became the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s closest talmid. Though he never gained the prominence that some of the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s other confidantes assumed with the passing of the Chazon Ish in 1953, Nadel did become the head of the Vizhnitz yeshiva.&nbsp; Rav Chaim Kanievsky was Rav Gedalyah's chavrusa. At the advice of the Chazon Ish, when Rav Gedalyah was still young, he began to study in the Lomza Yeshiva in Petach Tikvah. He married the daughter of Rav Eliyahu Weiner, a student of the Chofetz Chaim.

Born in Padua, Italy, the Ramchal was a student of Rabbi Yitzchak Lampronti, author of the Pachad Yitzchak, the first major Talmudic encyclopedia ever assembled. The novelty of his approach drew opposition from a number of his contemporaries. Partially as a result of this opposition, Luzzatto left his native Italy in 1735 and settled in Amsterdam. In 1743, he traveled to Eretz Israel and settled in Acco. He died in a plague only four years later, along with his wife and his son. The Vilna Gaon declared that the Ramchal had the most profound understanding of Yiddishkeit that any mortal human could attain. He furthermore stated that if Luzzatto were alive in his generation, he would go by foot from Vilna to Italy to sit at his feet and learn from him. According to a mesorah, the Gaon was going to Eretz Yisrael to be a talmid of the Ramchal but then found out that the Ramchal was niftar so he returned to Vilna. There is an interesting mesorah that the Ramchal was a gilgul of Rebbe Akiva. The two are buried right next to each other and the Ramchal was niftar when he was 40; it is said to make up for the first 40 years of Rebbe Akiva&rsquo;s life, prior to his doing teshuva.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Rema named his glosses Mappah (\"Tablecloth\"), as a \"cover\" for the Shulchan Aruch (\"the Set Table\"). These glosses have been incorporated into the text and are distinguishable in that they are printed in Rashi script. This consolidation of the two works symbolizes the underlying unity of the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities. It is thru this unification that the Shulchan Aruch became the universally accepted Code of Law for the entire Jewish people. (Of course, this is not to say that the Shulchan Aruch is the last word on halacha; many commentaries followed.) The Rema also wrote Darkei Moshe, a commentary on the Arba&rsquo;ah Turim, and the Torah Chattas. He became a son-in-law of Rav Shalom Shachna, Rosh Yeshiva of Lublin.

Yosef Dov (1820-1892) was born in Nisvizh, near Minsk, to Reb Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. Rav Yitzchak Zev was a grandson through his mother of Rav Chaim of Volozhin. Although Reb Yitzchak Zev was not a Rav he was known as a baki in Shas and Shulchan Aruch. By the time Yosef Dov was ten he knew Mesechtas Bava Kama, Bava Metzia, Bava Basra, Brachos, Gittin and Kiddushin by heart and was already writing his own chiddushim. When he was 11 his father brought him to Volozhin to learn under his uncle, Rav Itzeleh, the Rosh Yeshiva and son of Rav Chaim of Volozhin. After his marriage, his father-in-law supported him for thirteen years. In 1849, Rav Itzeleh of Volozhin passed away. Less than four years later, his successor, Rav Eliezer Yitzchak Fried also passed away. The Rabbanim decided that two descendants of Rav Chaim of Volozhin, the Netziv and the Beis Haleivi, would lead the yeshiva. The Netziv would be Rosh Yeshiva and the Beis Haleivi would be assistant Rosh Yeshiva.The sefer Beis Haleivi is comprised primarily from the shiurim he gave in Volozhin. His derech halimud was something that was completely new and original to the Volozhiner Yeshiva and was very different from the traditional way that shiurim were given there. His sefer Beis Haleivi was published in 1863. In 1865, a delegation from the city of Slutzk came to the Beis Haleivi to present him with a ksav rabbanus that was signed by all of the respected members of the community and recommended by Rav Yitzchak Elchonon Spektor, the Kovno Rav. The Beis Haleivi served as Rav of Slutzk for close to ten years, but his unbending battle against the maskilim and the wealthy eventually forced him from the city. In 1865, a delegation from Brisk came to him and offered him the position of Rav to replace Rav Yehoshua Leib Diskin who had just moved to Eretz Yisrael. The Beis Haleivi served as Rav in Brisk for 17 years until his passing.</span></h2>",

His first major work, the Beis Yosef is a comprehensive commentary on the Tur; it took 20 years to write. In it, he gathered the opinions and decisions of all the major authorities up until his time and cross-referenced them. He ruled between differing views on the basis of a consensus between the three preeminent halachic authorities, the Rif, the Rambam, and the Rosh. The work was completed in 1542, but he continued to refine it for the next 12 years, and published a second edition. After he had completed the Beis Yosef, Rav Caro made a summary of his rulings in the form of an index without reference to sources and titled it Shulchan Aruch (\"Laid Table\"). It was completed in 1555 in Israel; it was first published in Venice in 1565. Eventually, the Rama's gloss (called HaMapa -- \"The Tablecloth\") was published together with the Shulchan Aruch in Cracow in 1578, and together they became the universally recognized Code of Jewish Law. The Rambam had published his Mishna Torah without references for his rulings. The Maggid Mishna, a commentary on Mishneh Torah written by Rabbi Vidal di Tolouse, had referenced six of the fourteen sections of the work, and Rav Caro set out to complete the references, while at the same time explaining the Rambam's view and defending it from the Raavad. The Kesef Mishneh, as it was called, was published in Venice between the years 1574-76.&nbsp; Some of Rav Karo&rsquo;s sehilos u&rsquo;teshuvos can be found in the sefer Avkat Rokhel.</span></h2>",

Born in Pinchov, he lost his father at an early age. Soon after his bar mitzvah, the Warsaw gevir, Rav Naftali Tzvi Tzinimer, made the shidduch for Rav Chaim to marry his daughter Rochel. Rav Chaim moved to Warsaw, making it his home for the next 80 years. When Hoffmann, the chief Prussian administrator of Warsaw, insisted that every Jew adopt a surname for use on official documents in 1795, Reb Chaim took the name Davidson, in honor of his father. In addition to studying at the yeshiva of the Nesivos in Lissa, Rav Chaim often visited and studied with Rabbi Akiva Eiger. In the early 1800s, the Jewish population of Warsaw was skyrocketing, largely because of refugees coming in from the Ukraine and other places. From 2,519 Jews in 1765, the Jewish presence shot up to 15,000 by 1816. In 1802, the maskilim were numerous enough to open their own shul, which they named the \"German Synagogue.\" After 1815 when Russia annexed Warsaw, a deadly partnership developed between the autonomous Polish government and Haskala Jews. An edict in 1821 decreed the abolition of the kehillos, and substituted them with \"Congregational Boards\" consisting of the rav, his assistant, and three trustees. In 1822, Rav Chaim was chosen as one of Warsaw's three trustees and held this position for two years. After the passing of the Chemdas Shlomo in 1839, a council appointed Rav Chaim to be the new Rav of Warsaw. Thereafter, his wealthy son, Rav Naftali, supplied him with funds to continue the numerous chesed projects he had financed while he himself was a wealthy man.</span></h2>",

Rav Gershon lost his first wife in 1649, and his second wife in 1654. His third wife, Rebbetzin Raizel, was zocheh to arichas yamim, outliving her husband by 30 years. Rav Gershon served as dayan in Krakow, and in 1650 served the kehila of Prussnitz, Moravia. With the petira of his father-in-law, the Tzemach Tzedek in 1661, he became Rav in Nicholsburg and a year later of the entire province of Moravia. He served as chief Rabbi of Austria until the expulsion of 1670. At that point, he became Rav of Metz, Germany, where he remained until his petira. He is the author of Avodas HaGershuni, which deals with a wide range of Halachah. Much of what we know about the Chmielnicki massacres are based on this work. A prolific writer, he also composed Tiferes HaGershuni comprising his drashas on the Torah, and Chidushei HaGershuni on Halacha.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

He was the leader of the aliya of the followers of the Vilna Gaon to Eretz Yisrael. This is significant because of the many Minhagei Yerushalayim that were established by that Ashkenazi community. Rav Menachem Mendel was chosen by the Vilna Gaon to commit the latter's chiddushim to writing.&nbsp; His leading student, Yitzchak Eizak Chaver Wildmann (1789-1853), perceived that the obscurity of the kabbalistic system was a major factor in the flight of students and thinkers from Torah to science, secular philosophy and atheism. In Pischey She'arim, R. Yitzchak Eizak Chaver vindicates the kabbalah against its detractors, showing that behind its metaphors lies the only system with the power to provide satisfying answers to man's deepest questions about the meaning and purpose of the universe. The sefer Mishlei with the commentary of the Gra, acclaimed and accepted by Jewry worldwide, was written solely by his talmid R' Mendel of Shklov. However, R' Mendel admits that not all the peirushim are exactly as the Gra told him. \"There are some things that I understood from the Gaon's hints and (after writing them) I asked if I had expressed his opinion, and he nodded his head to me.\" Rav Menachem Mendel wrote a commentary on Sefer HaPeliah.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

When Be&rsquo;er Hagolah was originally established, Rav German was a part of the vaad hachinuch, along with Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky, Rav Shneur Kotler, Rav Elya Svei, Rav Aharon Schechter and the Novominsker Rebbe. Rav German threw himself into helping the school. Their leadership completely turned the school around, transforming it into a most formidable force in Russian education. Rav German arrived in Starret City in the 1970s, when there was barely a minyan of shomer Shabbos Jews there. Today, it is a thriving community. Not only that, but his shul, Bnai Israel of Starret City, is the only shul in the entire area. The Germans&rsquo; kiruv efforts, both in shul and school, were legendary. On Pesach, they would conduct a Seder for hundreds of Russian Jews.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

His works include the multi-volume Darash Av, on Chumash and the festivals, and the multi-volume halachic responsa, Beis Av.

Moshe was only thirteen years old when Cordova fell into the hands of the fanatical Almohades, and Rav Maimon and the other Jews were compelled to choose between Islam and exile. Rav Maimon and his family chose the latter course, and for twelve years led a nomadic life, wandering throughout Spain. In 1160 they settled at Fez, Morocco. In 1165 they went to Acre, to Jerusalem, and then to Fostat (Cairo), where they settled. After the death of Maimon, Moses' brother Dovid supported the family by trading in precious stones. Dovid perished at sea, and with him was lost not only his own fortune, but large sums that had been entrusted to him by other traders. These events affected Maimonides' health, and he went through a long sickness. After several years of practice, the Rambam&rsquo;s authority in medical matters was firmly established, and he was appointed private physician to Saladin's vizier, who recommended him to the royal family.

Rav Gershon Henoch travelled from Radzin to Italy in search of the Chilazon, the marine source from which the dye was obtained. The Chilazon carried the dye in a special sac located in its pharynx. In the famed aquarium at Naples he saw the Chilazon (tuttlefish) and studied the way in which the dye was removed and prepared. He discovered that it was used by artists in their paintings because it would never fade. Although the Maharsham wore a tallis (in private) using Rav Gershon Henoch&rsquo;s techeiles, in the end, only Radziner Chassidim and some Berslovers wear this techeiles. In recent years, several other species of fish have been suggested as the genuine techeiles. Among his sefarim are Sod Yesharim on the Torah and Yamim Tovim, Orchos Chaim and the tzavaah of the Tanna Rabi Eliezer ben Horkinus, Tiferes Hachanochi on the Zohar, and Sidrei Taharos (a collection of the relevant material from the whole Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, and all other Braysos, presented in chronological order). He also compiles and published the work of his father (Bais Yaakov) and grandfather (Mei Hashiloach).&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Eventually, with the help of some Modzitzer Chassidim, he and some family members reached the shores of San Francisco and then moved to Brooklyn in 1940. Reb Shaul was probably the most prolific chassidic composer of all time with the total output numbering close to 1000 compositions. His teachings have been collected in the volumes of Imrei Shaul and Yisa Bracha.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

When Rav Simcha Bunim of Peshischa passed away in 1827, his followers split into two streams, some of them following Rav Menachem Mendel of Kotzk whose emphasis was on fiery self-discipline, while the remainder adhered to Rav Yitzchak of Vorka whose approach was one of warmth and love. In 1848, when Rav Yitzchak of Vorka passed away, many of his followers wished to follow Rav Yaakov Dovid of Amshinov. He, too, followed the Vorka tradition of kindness and kiruv rechokim. Rav Yaakov Dovid set up court in the town of Mszczonow, Poland, which became known to Jews as Amshinov. There, he became known as the rebbe of Amshinov. Meanwhile, Rav Yaakov Dovid&rsquo;s brother, Rav Menachem Mendel, continued the Vorki dynasty from their father in Vorki itself (1779-1848).

He was engaged to the Rav of Berditchev at the age of seven; six years later, the chasuna took place. When Reb Yisrael turned sixteen his older brother, Reb Avraham (who had succeeded their father), was niftar, leaving no children. He was then succeeded by Reb Yisrael. When word reached the Rebbe that the Russian Czar intended to build a big church in the Old City of Yerushalayim, the Rebbe summoned Reb Nisan Bak who lived in Yerushalayim. Reb Nisan arrived there a few days ahead of the Russians and succeeded in buying the plot of land. The Czar was forced to buy a different plot of land, known today as the Russian Compound. The shul was known as the \"Reb Nisan Bak Shul\" and stood until 1948 when it was destroyed by the Arabs. Following the orders of the Czar, the Rebbe was locked up in the Kiev dungeons. The Rebbe spent 22 months locked in a small dark and damp cellar. A few days after the Rebbe was freed he fled Russia and settled in the town of Sadiger. The Rebbe's derech was carried on through his six sons. The Rebbe's oldest son, Reb Shalom Yosef, was niftar less than a year after his father and was succeeded by his son Reb Yitzchak, who became the first Bohusher Rebbe. The Ruzhiner's second son, Reb Avraham Yaakov, took his father's place in Sadiger. He had two sons, the eldest, Reb Yitzchak, was the first Boyaner Rebbe and the younger son, Reb Yisrael, was rebbe in Sadiger. The third son of the Ruzhiner was Reb Dov Ber who was rebbe in Lieov and the fourth son, Reb Menachem Nachum, was rebbe in Sthefanesht. The fifth son was Reb Dovid Moshe, the Chortkover Rebbe, and the sixth son was Reb Mordechai Shraga, the Husyatiner Rebbe. The Ruzhiner also had four daughters. The third daughter, Miriam, was married to Reb Menachem Mendel of Vishnitz, founder of the Vishnitzer dynasty.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

In 1814, Rav Zvi Hirsch Kara died, and R' Avraham Dovid was offered the rabbinate of Buczacz in his place.It is as the Rav of Buczacz that R' Avraham David is best known, and it was there that he spent the remainder of his days. His best known works are Da'as Kedoshim (on Yoreh Deah), and Eishel Avraham (on Orach Chaim).]&nbsp;</span></h2>",

In Toledo, he focused on limud Torah, and in the course of six months produced an extensive commentary on the books of Yehoshua, Shoftim, and Shmuel.

In 1503, in Venice, his services were employed in negotiating a commercial treaty between Portugal and the Venetian republic. He was buried in Padua next to Rav Yehudah Minz, Rav of Padua.

From Ponovezh, Rav Dovid went on to study in Kollel Beis Yisrael of Slabodka. After his marriage, he and his wife were supported by his father-in-law, during which period Rav Dovid was able to compile his second major work, Mikdash Dovid, which focuses on the tractates of Kodshim, Taharos, Bechoros and Sanhedrin. Then, during World War One, Rav Dovid had to flee and found refuge in Vilna. Later on, Rav Elchanan Wasserman invited Rav Dovid to deliver shiurim in Yeshivas Ohel Torah in Baranovich.This yeshiva was founded in 1907 at the initiative of Rav Yosef Yozel Horowitz, the Alter of Novhardok.

About 350,000 Jews lived in France at the time, more than half of whom were not French citizens. Under the terms of the armistice between France and Germany, northern France remained under German occupation. Southern France, which was not occupied by the Germans, was governed by an exclusively French administration based in the town of Vichy. The Vichy regime publicly declared neutrality in the war, but actually was active in passing antisemitic legislation and cooperated with Germany in the deportation of Jews from France.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</span></h2>",

(1809-1879). He was born in Volhynia and was still a child when his father died. &nbsp;He studied in his native town until the age of 13. &nbsp;He then went to Warsaw where he was known as the iluy from Volhynia. &nbsp;From 1838 to 1860, he served as Rav of Wreschen and Kempen. In 1860 Malbim became chief rabbi of Bucharest, Rumania. But he could not agree with the rich German Jews there who wished to introduce the Reform rite and even threatened violence in the pursuit of their aims. They succeeded in having him imprisoned, and though he was liberated through the intervention of Sir Moses Montefiore, it was upon the condition that he leave Rumania. He became Rav of Moghilef in 1870, but his lack of subservience pprovoked the resentment of the richer Jews, who denounced him as a political criminal. He then went to K&ouml;nigsberg as chief rabbi of the Polish community, but there he fared no better than in Bucharest and Moghilef; he was continually harassed by the German Jews. His fame and immense popularity rests upon his widely esteemed commentary to Tanach, in which he details the close relationship between the Oral and the Written Law.</span></h2>",
