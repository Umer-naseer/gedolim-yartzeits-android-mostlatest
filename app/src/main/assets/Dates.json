Born in Kopishak, Lithuania, he learned in Ponevezh, Talmud Torah Kelm and Slabodka. He was also a talmid of the Chofetz Chaim in Radin. While he was still quite young, he was appointed Rav of the Abba Yechezkel Kloiz in Slabodka. During World War II, he lived in the Kovno ghetto from June, 1941 until August 1, 1944. It was there that he recorded the gripping shaylos he received, publishing them later in five volumes of She'eilos Uteshuvos Mima'amakim. After the liberation, he was the only surviving Rav of Kovno. He worked diligently to restore Yiddishkeit and was especially active in rescuing children left with non-Jews. He then fled to Austria, where he founded a yeshiva in Welsh, a small town near Salzburg. He was then called upon to take over the leadership of the Meor Hagoloh yeshiva in Rome. He later went to America, where he served as Rav of the Beis Hamedrash Hagodol on the Lower East Side of New York City. He published Divrei Ephraim in 1949. He also published chiddushei Torah on many areas, including Imrei Ephraim on Nezikin and other subjects. He also wrote Yahadus Lita which appeared in Yiddish, about his recollections of pre-War Europe.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

He was 86 years old.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">A model of the mesorah of Telshe whose actions bespoke refinement in all his ways, with a deep ahavas haTorah and unyielding sense of responsibility to the klal, Rav Levin grew to be a revered manhig. As a Rosh Yeshivah, he implanted in the hearts and minds of American bachurim a desire and self-confidence that they too could reach great heights in Torah and avodah.</span></h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In his roles as a member of the Moetzes Gedolei haTorah of Agudath Israel of America, Yoshev Rosh of the Vaad Roshei Hayeshivos of Torah Umesorah, the de facto Torah manhig of Orthodox Jewry in Chicago, and as an address for advice for individuals of all walks of life, his clarity of thought and absolute loyalty to what he saw as truth would play a role in countless of the weightiest decisions</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;Sar v&rsquo;gadol nafal b&rsquo;Yisrael [a great prince has fallen in Klal Yisrael], not everyone with the title &lsquo;sar&rsquo; can be called a Gadol, Rav Avrohom Chaim, zt&rdquo;l, was a sar v&rsquo;gadol,&rdquo; said Harav Chaim Dov Keller, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Telshe Chicago, who has led the yeshivah together with Rav Levin since shortly after its founding. &ldquo;Rav Avrohom Chaim&rsquo;s purpose was to carry on the mesorah he had seen by his Rebbi, Harav Elya Meir [Bloch], zt&rdquo;l, that mesorah is not only a derech halimud and mussar, it&rsquo;s [to do all one can] for the sake of kvod Shamayim.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Avrohom Chaim Levin was born into a home rich with Torah and the principles of the great baalei mussar. His father, Harav Eliezer Levin, zt&rdquo;l, was a phenomenal talmid chacham who had spent many years studying in the Radin Yeshivah and where he was privileged to observe and learn from the Chofetz Chaim, and went on to become one of the prized talmidim of Kelm&rsquo;s famed Talmud Torah. Rav Eliezer served for several years as Rav in the Lithuanian town of Vashki, where his only son (the Levins also had several daughters) was born.</span></h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In the mid-1930s, Rav Levin, his wife, Rebbetzin Sarah Menucha, a&rdquo;h, and their young family immigrated to the United States and settled in Detroit where Rav Eliezer would go on to become one of the city&rsquo;s most prominent Rabbanim.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">With few options for chinuch in Detroit of the early 1940s, the Levins made the difficult, but fateful decision to send their young Avrohom Chaim to the Telshe Yeshivah, which had only recently been founded in Cleveland.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In Telshe, he quickly grew to be one of the beis medrash&rsquo;s elite talmidim spending hours poring over his Gemara with great hasmadah and mastering the shiurim of his Rebbeim. He would absorb not only the yeshivah&rsquo;s approach to Torah study rooted in an emphasis of arriving at the simple truth of each sugya; he came to embody its standards of gadlus haadam &mdash; a model of man controlled by an intellect refined by Torah, and a commitment to dedicate one&rsquo;s life to the needs of the tzibbur. His entire life, the teachings of his primary Rebbi, Harav Eliyahu Meir Bloch, would remain deeply planted within him; he would often quote his Rebbi&rsquo;s words and measure his actions against the standard his Rebbi had set.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In the late 1950s, Rav Avrohom Chaim married Esther Ginsburg, the daughter of Harav Ephraim Mordechai Ginsburg, zt&rdquo;l, Rosh Yeshivah of the Mirrer Yeshivah in Brooklyn, and a granddaughter of Harav Yechezkel Levenstein, zt&rdquo;l, the famed Mashgiach of the Mir in Poland and, later, of Ponevez in Bnei Brak.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 1960, while still in his 20s, Rav Avrohom Chaim was sent by Harav Mordechai (Mottel) Katz, zt&rdquo;l, together with Harav Chaim Schmeltzer, zt&rdquo;l, and a small group of talmidim from Cleveland to found a branch of Telshe in Chicago.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">From its humble beginnings, and through the relentless efforts of its founding Roshei Yeshivah and, ybl&rdquo;c, Rav Keller, who would join the hanhalah shortly afterward, the yeshivah grew into the city&rsquo;s flagship makom Torah, producing not only generations of talmidim, but raising the banner of Torah for the Chicago community.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">True to his standard for all aspects of life, Rav Levin&rsquo;s shiurim were rooted in an unyielding search for the truth. Avoiding complicated and seemingly mind dazzling &ldquo;pshetlach,&rdquo; he demanded of himself and, by extension, to his talmidim that all efforts be made to ensure that the most essential matters in the Gemara could be explained in the simplest way possible that stood the test of calculations from all sides.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">His own hasmadah set a shining example for bachurim. From his days as a young Rosh Yeshivah until his being recognized a one of the Gedolei hador, Rav Levin maintained an uncanny ability to uphold his daily learning schedule. This extended not only to the time he allotted for Torah, but with his constant striving for greater levels of self-disciple he was able to seemingly erase the many pressing and weighty matters that rested on his shoulders and focus intensely and solely on learning.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In his shmuessen, the Rosh Yeshivah set high goals for talmidim, speaking about the sense of malchus with which a Jew should live and that all of ones actions must not be for himself but for the betterment of Klal Yisrael, measured by the gauge of how much kvod Shamayim one can bring to the world.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Even in his early years, Rav Levin was guided by a deep sense of responsibility to the klal in every way. Not satisfied with the challenge of building up his yeshivah and teaching a growing number of talmidim, he put great efforts into establishing an Agudah division in Chicago, working closely with the organization both locally and nationally on a wide array of issues facing the tzibbur over the decades. Later, as a member of the Moetzes, he dedicated countless hours of his time studying the matters of the day and guiding askanim. Increasingly, he was called upon by other yeshivos for guidance and eventually became one of the main rabbinic leaders of Torah Umesorah. In Chicago as well, his advice was sought after by a wide array of the city&rsquo;s Rabbanim and his word was usually the last on matters facing the kehillah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Harav Shmuel Yehudah Levin, a son, said in his hesped that his great father epitomized the statement of Chazal that &ldquo;there is no one who is more precious to Hakadosh Baruch Hu than a shaliach [messenger] who is moser nefesh for his mission,&rdquo; and that he did.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;How many times did we hear from you that there is nothing in life besides doing your shelichus?&rdquo; he asked passionately in his hesped. &ldquo;We had a Rebbi who picked us up, [us] small people, he gave us big hasagos [and showed we could achieve] greatness.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">An additional levayah was scheduled to take place in Lakewood on Thursday morning at Beth Medrash Gevoha and, from there, for the aron to continue to Eretz Yisrael for kevurah in Bnei Brak.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The Rosh Yeshivah is survived by, ybl&rdquo;c, his wife, Rebbetzin Esther Levin; sons, Harav Shmuel Yehudah, Rabbi Yisrael Menachem, Rabbi Ephraim Mordechai, Rabbi Yitzchok Zev, Rabbi Yechezkel; daughter Rebbetzin Chaykie Zeilberger; as well as by many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Adopted from Hamodia.</span></h2>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Born in Livorno, Italy, of Sephardic descent, he traced his lineage back to the exiles from the Spanish Expulsion. When he was still a young child his family resettled in England. Young Moses became a member of the London Stock Exchange at a time when there were only 12 licensed Jewish brokers in all of England. In a matter of a few years he had amassed great wealth and had become a member of the London Aristocracy. In 1812, he married his wife Judith, whose sister was the wife of Reb Nathan Meyer Rothschild, one of the wealthiest Jews in Europe at the time. Sir Moses eventually became the stockbroker for his brother-in-law and as a result of their partnership they amassed a tremendous fortune. In addition, he was a partner in a large insurance company as well as a gas company that introduced gas lighting to many of the major cities of Europe. Sir Moses also had a hand in building railroads and many other industrial and financial enterprises. As the years passed, Moses and Judith grew together in their Yiddishkeit. In 1837, Montefiore was appointed Sheriff of London. In the same year, Queen Victoria, who had recently ascended the British Throne, awarded him the honorary title of Knighthood, bestowing upon him the title &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; Moses. In 1846, he was elevated to the rank of Baron. By the time he was 41 years old, Sir Moses retired from business affairs and devoted the rest of his life to Jewish affairs. When he was appointed as Sheriff of London, he specifically wrote in his contract that he would be absolved from working on Shabbos and Yom Tov. He also specified that he was to be absolved from entering a Church on non-Jewish holidays. Even when he was traveling, he almost always made sure to travel with an entourage of at least 10 Jews to ensure that he would have a minyan. He also took one of the many sifrei Torah that he owned along with him. In 1840, a monk named Thomas disappeared from his home several weeks before Pesach. The French Counsel in Damascus blamed the Jews for his disappearance and claimed that they killed the monk to use his blood for matzos. Prominent Damascus Jews were imprisoned and tortured. Many died and some, who could not withstand the torture, &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; under duress to the crime. Upon learning of it, Sir Moses traveled to Damascus to save the country and the honor of the Jewish people. In 1846, Sir Moses was invited by the Russian government to visit Russia in connection with its Jewish situation. Upon returning to London, he demanded equal rights for the Jews and stressed that it would also be an economic blessing for the country. Montefiore&rsquo;s 100th birthday was celebrated as an official holiday in London and he was accorded great honor by both Jew and non-Jew alike. The Montefiores died childless, but they left behind a legacy of tzedaka and chesed that endures to this very day.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

The Rosh Yeshivah disseminated Torah to his talmidim for more than half a century, and passed away after a difficult illness at the age of 78.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Rafael was born in 5698/1938 to Harav Chaim and Rebbetzin Miriam Shmuelevitz. His mother was the only daughter of Harav Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, zt&rdquo;l, Rosh Yeshivas Mir, in the town of Mir, Poland, who was the son of Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, the Alter of Slabodka and the son-in-law of Harav Eliyahu Baruch Kamai. The sandak at his bris was his great-uncle, Harav Avraham Tzvi Kamai, Hy&rdquo;d, the Rav of Mir.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 5696/1936, his father, Rav Chaim, was appointed to serve as Rosh Yeshivah in Mir, and during the war years, when the yeshivah traveled first to Japan and then to Shanghai, the Rosh Yeshivah went along, guiding the yeshivah skillfully and providing for all the physical and spiritual needs of the talmidim.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">At the time, he secretly exchanged letters with Harav Avraham Kalmanowitz, of America, about sending money to Shanghai to support the yeshivah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">One day, Rav Chaim was summoned to the Japanese police station where they asked how 350 yeshivah bachurim under his supervision subsisted. He said that everyone knew that no one came out of the Japanese gendarmerie alive, and he became very afraid.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;I davened in my heart, &lsquo;Ribbono shel Olam, if I am destined to perish here, I will go happily, but if I return alive, Father in Heaven, I ask of You three things. First, when I emerge from this gehinnom, absolve me of the financial burden; second, that I should merit to marry my daughters off to talmidei chachamim, and third, that I merit to raise sons who are talmidei chachamim.&rsquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;Rabbosai, I had the merit to ask because when a person is gripped with the fear of death, he is allowed to ask. Although ultimately I emerged from there, I cannot relate what happened on the third floor of that building&hellip; But I returned and two of my tefillos have already been fulfilled. I am free of the financial burden and my third daughter is marrying a talmid chacham today. The third tefillah will yet be fulfilled&hellip;&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Once the war was over, the entire yeshivah emigrated to America or other locales. Only after everyone was on safe shores did Rav Chaim embark on a journey to Eretz Yisrael with his two children.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">First he went to America, where he spent a few months with his students. Although he was asked to serve as Rosh Yeshivah in America, he yearned to go to Eretz Yisrael and to learn peacefully alongside his father-in-law in Yerushalayim. Indeed, after a short time, he was able to fulfill this dream.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When they reached Eretz Yisrael, Rav Rafael was nine years old. He attended Talmud Torah Yavneh, and later Yeshivas Tiferes Tzvi. Even before his bar mitzvah, he learned in Yeshivas Mir alongside his father, the Rosh Yeshivah. Everyone knew that he was brilliant and blessed with many talents, among them his remarkable diligence. Already as a young bachur he learned with his father b&rsquo;chavrusa every day, and on Shabbos, his grandfather, Harav Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, would test him. Thus, even before his marriage, he studied most masechtos in Shas in depth. The daily chavrusa with his father continued until the latter&rsquo;s passing.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">While still a young bachur, his divrei Torah were published in various journals, and Harav Yechezkel Abramsky, zt&rdquo;l, who saw them, remarked that there was a future for the Torah world.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">A significant facet of Rav Rafael&rsquo;s life was his dissemination of Torah. Some two years after his marriage, at the age of 27, he was asked to serve as a Maggid Shiur in Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael Chevron. His breadth of knowledge far exceeded his young years, and his shiurim and chiddushei Torah became renowned for their brilliance and clarity. Many in Yeshivas Chevron at the time maintained that he was their rebbi muvhak until his final day. At the same time, he also served as a R&rdquo;M in Yeshivas Kol Yaakov.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Rafael was known for his proficiency in all areas of Torah, and his shiurim covered some of the most complex sugyos in Shas.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">On Zos Chanukah 5739/1978, Harav Chaim Shmuelevitz passed away and Rav Rafael was asked to take his father&rsquo;s place as Rosh Yeshivah, a position he kept until his final days. Hundreds of talmidim who came to the yeshivah from abroad streamed to listen to his shiurim. Ultimately, many of his talmidim became marbitzei Torah in their own right.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">During those years he worked to publish his father&rsquo;s divrei Torah. At the same time, Sichos Mussar was published, written largely by Rav Rafael and ybl&rdquo;c Harav Aryeh Finkel, shlita, which was a compilation of Rav Chaim&rsquo;s shmuessen. Later, he worked with his brothers to publish sifrei Shaarei Chaim on Shas.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">This past year, Rav Raphael&rsquo;s sons published the first sefer, Shiurei Rabi Raphael on Maseches Kiddushin, which has become widely studied in yeshivos around the world.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In addition to his erudition in Torah, Rav Rafael was known for his tremendous wisdom. His talmidim would consult him regularly on all matters in their lives, and his unique advice, as well as his genuine concern for them, brought talmid and rebbi very close. He was extremely devoted to his talmidim, and every trouble that they encountered pained him.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was known for his generous heart, like his father, and whenever he spoke of other people&rsquo;s tzaros, tears would form in his eyes, even when he was speaking of people he did not know personally.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was also exceptional in the middah of anivus. He did not &ldquo;hold of himself&rdquo; at all, and did not deem it below him to perform even the most mundane tasks when necessary. He would walk in the streets simply, like everyone else. He refused to sit on the Mizrach wall in the yeshivah, and when people sought to accord him honor, he never understood why they wanted to.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When his fellow Rosh Yeshivah, Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, zt&rdquo;l, began opening additional batei medrash in Yerushalayim and Modiin Illit, Rav Rafael was asked to deliver shiurim klaliim there. Despite the exertion involved, he gladly agreed to disseminate Torah wherever possible.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The Roshei Yeshivah, zt&rdquo;l, shared a wonderful relationship. The talmidim at the yeshivah would marvel at the mutual respect they accorded one another, which was manifested countless times. Over the years they would sit in on each other&rsquo;s shiurim.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The talmidim in the yeshivah in Modiin Illit remember longingly the Shabbosos he spent at the yeshivah, during which he would deliver several chaburos and shiurim. He was their role model in learning Torah with great enthusiasm and diligence.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was also very careful to utilize every minute of time, and would often remark, regarding various chumros: &ldquo;We are machmir about bitul Torah!&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The levayah took place on Tuesday morning at Yeshivas Mir. Hespedim were delivered by Harav Aryeh Finkel, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Mir-Brachfeld; Harav Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Mir-Yerushalayim; Harav Baruch Dov Povarsky, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Ponevez; Harav Yitzchak Ezrachi, a brother-in-law of the niftar, who serves as a Rosh Yeshivah in Mir; Harav Moshe Mordechai Farbstein, a brother-in-law and Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Chevron; Reb Rafael&rsquo;s son, Harav Yaakov Shmuelevitz; his son-in-law, Harav Avraham Segal, R&rdquo;M, Yeshivas Mir-Brachfeld; and Harav Dovid Cohen, Rosh Yeshivah, Yeshivas Chevron.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The levayah then proceeded to Har Hamenuchos, where Harav Rafael was buried next to his illustrious father, Hagaon Harav Chaim Shmuelevitz, zt&rdquo;l.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He is survived by tbl&rdquo;c his chashuve almanah, Rebbetzin Edna, tlit&rdquo;a; his brothers, Rav Avraham and Rav Meir; his sisters, the wives of Rav Yitzchak Ezrachi and Rav Yisrael Meir Weiss; his sons, Rav Yaakov, who took his father&rsquo;s place at Yeshivas Mir in recent years; Rav Eliezer Yehudah, shlita, a marbitz Torah in Mosdos Yad Mordechai near Paris; Rav Yechezkel and Rav Ben Tzion Yosef, eminent talmidim at the Mir; Rav Nosson Tzvi, one of the Rabbanim in Yeshivas Nesivos Chochmah; and his daughters, Rebbetzin Sarah Segal, from Mir-Brachfeld; Rebbetzin Malka Shapiro; Rebbetzin Efrat Piness; and Rebbetzin Etty Wolf; grandchildren, great grandchildren and many talmidim all over the world.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><em>&nbsp;</em></span></h2>\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><em>(source: Hamodia)</em></span></pre>",

      "subjectDescription": "<h1><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Dovid Yitzchak Eizik Rabinowitz</span></h1>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Harav Dovid Yitzchak Eizik Rabinowitz was born in Brad, Czechoslovakia, in the summer of 5698/1898. His father, Reb Baruch Pinchas, was the son of Harav Eliezer Chaim of Yampoli, whose grandfather, Harav Yitzchak of Yampoli, was a grandson of the Zlotchover Maggid (Harav Yechiel Michel) and a son-in-law of the Rebbe Reb Baruch&rsquo;l of Mezibuzh (grandson of the Baal Shem Tov). He traced his lineage to Rashi, Maharal, Rema, and the Shelah (R. Isaiah HaLevi Horowitz 1565-1630).</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Even when he was a young child reb Dovid Yitzchak enjoyed writing his original torah thoughts. He would write his own original chiddushim late at night.&nbsp; In the frost of the Galician winter, he would climb up to the attic and write---until the ink would freeze.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">At the age of 14, young Dovid Yitzchak Eizik received warm semichah from a number of leading Gedolei Hador, among them Harav Meir Arik. A short time later, he married the daughter of Harav Chaim Eizen of Svirzh, a granddaughter of Harav Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin. Tragically, just a few months after their chasunah, the town of Svirzh was raided by soldiers who pillaged Jewish homes. The young Rebbetzin jumped out a window to her death.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">For the next five years, through World War I, Reb Dovid was at his father&rsquo;s side, enduring imprisonment and privation. After years of wandering, Skolya Chassidut was re-established in Vienna, where Reb Baruch Pinchas emerged as a leading figure for the burgeoning refugee community. A magnificent Skolya beit medrash was erected, and the Chassidut thrived.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">During this period, the Rebbe married Yocheved Esther Devorah, the daughter of Harav Moshe Dovid Landau, the Rav of Burshtyn.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">On 20 Adar 5680/1920, Reb Baruch Pinchas was niftar, and his son was crowned Rebbe.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The reputation of the young Skolya Rebbe as a talmid chacham and a baal mofet spread, and he was invited to spend Shabbatot in kehillot across Poland, Galicia, Romania and Hungary, though he remained based in Vienna. The Chassidut flourished until World War II.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">As the danger grew, the Rebbe sent his wife and children, who were Austrian citizens, abroad, while he, accompanied only by his son Reb Yosef Baruch Pinchas, hid in the home of his brother-in-law, Reb Shalom Frankel.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Through open miracles, he and his son eventually reached Switzerland, where they were reunited with the rest of the family. At the end of the summer of 1939 they arrived in America, and the Rebbe settled on Henry Street on the Lower East Side. By that time, he had written most of his more than twenty seforim on a wide range of torah topics.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 5701/1941, the Rebbe established one of the first chassidic shtieblach in Williamsburg, and the Skolya beit medrash would remain a magnet for people seeking Torah and Chassidut for the next 30 years.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 5734/1974, the Rebbe acquiesced to the requests of his children and Chassidim and settled in Boro Park. During the last five years of his life, his beit medrash on 48th Street hummed with people.The Rebbe was an outstanding shaliach tzibbur. His sweet voice was complemented by the feeling of love and awe of his Creator, which permeated his words.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Reb Dovid Yitzchak Eizik was known for genius and depth in Torah learning. At his tischen, someone would be invited to read a passuk from the parashah. The Rebbe would instantly begin to expound on the passuk, continuing for up to two hours. The person honored with giving the Rebbe the passuk was usually a guest or somebody prominent. The Rebbe never failed to hold rapt those present at the tisch.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Once, a prominent Rav in Ireland who was hosting the Rebbe said, &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the Rebbe tell the truth! Everyone knows that the Rebbe chooses which passuk is going to be said ahead of time.&rdquo; The Rebbe asked the Rav for a passuk. &ldquo;Reuven, Shimon, Levi, v&rsquo;Yehudah,&rdquo; answered the Rav. The Rebbe closed his eyes, and expounded on the passuk until the Rav had to stop him at 2:30 a.m. He begged the Rebbe&rsquo;s forgiveness. &ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; said the Rebbe, &ldquo;but in the future, please don&rsquo;t accuse another Jew of lying.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">During the last year of his life, the Rebbe dropped several hints that his end was near. In the winter of 5739/1979 he took ill. His family brought him to London for treatment and there, on 6 Shvat, Shabbos night, Parashat Bo, he was niftar.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was buried on Har Hazeitim, next to Harav Shloime of Zhvill, like him a ben achar ben of the Zlotchover Maggid.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">His wrote more than twenty seforim and his work was revered by Talmudic giants, receiving approbations from Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and the Steipler among others.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

His genius was unparalleled and his breadth of knowledge unsurpassed in his time.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Born on August 22, 1938, Rav Belsky was a son of Rabbi Berel and Chana Tzirel Belsky. His maternal grandfather was the legendary Torah pioneer, Rav Binyomin Wilhelm zt&rdquo;l, founder of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Belsky learned at and received semichah from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in 1962, and from Rav Moshe Feinstein zt&rdquo;l in 1965. He later studied at Bais Medrash Elyon in Monsey, NY, for a number of years, becoming one of its most prominent talmidim.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rev Belsky served as the senior posek of the OU Kashrus Division, a position he held since 1987. He served as rov of Camp Agudah since 1967.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Belsky&rsquo;s chiddushei Torah have been printed in volumes titled Piskei Halachos, Einei Yisroel on Chumash, Sha&rsquo;alos U&rsquo;Teshuvos Shulchan Halevi, and other publications.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In addition to his gadlus in Torah, Rav Belsky possessed a heart that was open to all Jews, and he gave of his time, wisdom and abilities to help people from across the spectrum of Yiddishkeit. Despite the great burdens he carried on his shoulders, guiding so many Jews in so many different facets of life, Rav Belsky continued to extend himself on behalf of others, opening his home to people who came to him for help at all times of the day and night.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Those close to the rosh yeshiva attest to the fact that while all he wished to do was sit and learn the Torah that was so beloved to him, he sacrificed his time to pasken shailos and answer halachah queries on a continuous basis. From early morning until well past midnight, Rav Belsky was working on behalf of Klal Yisroel, serving as a shliach Hashem and imparting advice and guidance from his wellspring of Torah knowledge.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Belsky was a fount of information and was a master of all subjects. His grasp of so many varied areas was mind-boggling, yet he was humble and approachable. Rav Belsky related to seasoned talmidei chachomim and young bochurim who looked up to him as a gadol baTorah. This was one of the remarkable traits of the rosh yeshiva, who, despite his genius, could explain the most complex topics in simple, clear terms.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Whether it was the writers of the ArtScroll Schottenstein Gemara or other talmidei chachomim seeking clarity in some of the most esoteric sugyos in Shas, Rav Belsky was the address. Those who spoke to him came away stunned by his brilliance and aptitude, and touched by the manner in which he articulated himself.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The Torah world remains bereft upon the first yahrtzeit. In many ways, Rav Belsky was a once-in-a-generation type of Torah giant whose passing has left a void that is gaping and painful even a year after the petirah.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Watch this amazing short video about this Rav:&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<br /><a href=\"https://yartzeits.com/video4/\"><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://yartzeits.com/watchvideoicon.png\" alt=\"Qries\" width=\"150&quot;\" height=\"70\" /></a>",

Avraham was a disciple of Dov Ber, the Magid of Mezritsh, and a follower and colleague of Rabbi Menaḥem Mendel of Vitebsk. It is said that before his attachment to Hasidism he had apparently studied with the Gaon of Vilna. Avraham assisted Menaḥem Mendel in leading a group of Hasidim to the Land of Israel in 1777 and then moved with him from Safed to Tiberias. Letters to their followers in Belorussia&ndash;Lithuania are signed by both rabbis, with Avraham occasionally adding his own words. When Menaḥem Mendel died in 1788, the Hasidim of Tiberias, as well as a portion of followers in Eastern Europe, deemed Avraham to be their leader.</span></h2>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady published his Tanya in 1796, Avraham, who considered himself to be Shneur Zalman&rsquo;s senior, denounced the publication of the book. He was particularly critical of the Tanya&rsquo;s exposition of mystical ideas. A bitter dispute erupted between the two friends, both disciples of the Magid and of Menaḥem Mendel and therefore, one might have thought, exponents of the same Hasidic teachings. The two men never reconciled. In one letter, Shneur Zalman blamed Avraham&rsquo;s followers for behavior that had precipitated the Bans of Excommunication of Hasidim issued in 1772.</span></h2>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Although Avraham&rsquo;s position within the hierarchy of the Magid&rsquo;s disciples was higher than that of Shneur Zalman, Avraham&rsquo;s community depended on donations from East European Hasidim, and Shneur Zalman was responsible for collecting these funds. Their ideological&ndash;theological dispute affected this practical matter as well. Avraham accused Shneur Zalman of blocking contributions intended for the Galilee community and in 1805 appointed Mordekhai of Lakhovits in his place to oversee the collections.</span></h2>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Avraham&rsquo;s form of mysticism was esoteric and extremely demanding. Aimed at a select few, it focused on intimacy and contemplation and called for a state of perpetual devekut, or communion with Hashem. For those who could not maintain this devotion continually, Avraham suggested the alternative method of dibuk ḥaverim, adhering to other persons in the state of devekut. According to this principle, the contemplative believer would not suffer interruption in communing with Hashem.</span></h2>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Some of Avraham&rsquo;s teachings appear in Ḥesed le-Avraham (1851). Igeret ha-kodesh (1794) includes teachings from both Menaḥem Mendel of Vitebsk and Avraham of Kalisk.</span></h2>",

Born in Lisbon, Portugal,&nbsp; into one of the oldest and most distinguished Jewish Iberian families who had escaped persecution in Castille during 1391.&nbsp; In addition to his intellectual abilities, he showed a complete mastery of financial matters. This attracted the attention of King Afonso V of Portugal who employed him as treasurer. In 1483, he had to flee to Castille, having been falsely accused by King John II of conspiracy. In Toledo, he focused on limud Torah, and in the course of six months produced an extensive commentary on the books of Yehoshua, Shoftim, and Shmuel. When the banishment of the Jews from Spain was ordered with the Alhambra decree, he left nothing undone to induce the king to revoke the edict. In vain did he offer him 30,000 ducats ($68,400 nominal value). With his brethren in faith he left Spain and went to Naples, where, soon after, he entered the service of the king. In 1503, in Venice, his services were employed in negotiating a commercial treaty between Portugal and the Venetian republic. He was buried in Padua next to Rav Yehudah Minz, Rav of Padua. Among his many works are Ma'yanei ha-Yeshu'ah (peirush on Sefer Daniel), Yeshu'os Meshiho (rabbinic literature about Mashiach), Mashmi'a Yeshu'ah (peirush on the messianic prophecies in Sifrei Navi).

He was named after his grandfather, the Imrei Baruch of Vizhnitz. He became Rav of Polein-Riskova, and then served as the Rav of Kotzman, Romania, for nine years. He established a Talmud Torah, a Bais Yaakov school and worked extensively for Agudas Yisrael. In 1935, Rav Baruch moved to Seret, a Romanian town of about 2,000 Jews. The Ahavas Yisrael passed away soon afterwards and Rav Baruch became the Admor of Seret-Vizhnitz. It is estimated that of about 150,000 Romanian Jews exiled to Transnistria (including all those from Seret), some 90,000 were murdered. Rav Baruch was ransomed for a huge sum in Adar of 1944 and made his way back to Romania. He finally moved to Antwerp, Belgium in 1946 together with his brother, the Imrei Chaim, and they stayed there for close to a year. He arrived in Eretz Yisrael in Sivan 1947, and set off to Haifa where he set up his court. There Rav Baruch established a yeshiva, a Talmud Torah and other Torah institutions. This laid the ground for the establishment of the famous community of Ramat Vizhnitz, built on the side of Haifa's Mount Carmel, laying its foundation stone on the 3rd day of Tammuz, 1954.

He strongly eschewed honor and conducted himself with great dedication to the middah of emes.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was born in 1936 in Berlin. His father, Reb Yisrael Avraham Kushitzki, Hy&rdquo;d, was a highly respected Radomsker Chassid, who was tragically killed in the Holocaust. Shortly after the war, young Tzvi Yehudah&rsquo;s&nbsp; mother, Rebbetzin Bronya, a&rdquo;h, married the Bluzhever Rebbe, who raised young Tzvi Yehudah and, ybc&rdquo;l, his younger brother, Yitzchak Elazar, as his own children.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The tales of how the future Rebbe survived the horrors of the World War II are a series of unbelievable nissim. He survived being thrown from a train headed to certain death, and left a ghetto hospital a day before all of its patients and staff were murdered.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">It was in this dark period that young Tzvi Yehudah formed his initial bond with the previous Bluzhever Rebbe, zt&rdquo;l, who was also interned in Bergen-Belsen. Despite the crushing loss of his own wife and children, he expended tremendous efforts to offer encouragement and strength to his fellow suffering Jews.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Following the conclusion of the war, young Tzvi Yehudah was reunited with his mother and brother. They lived for a short while in Eretz Yisrael before immigrating to America. After Rebbetzin Bronya&rsquo;s remarriage, the family settled in Williamsburg, where the Bluzhever beis medrash had been established.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">From the time that he first arrived in America, the (previous) Bluzhever Rebbe invested tremendous efforts into raising young Tzvi Yehudah, in whom he saw the continuation of the hallowed legacy of his ancestors. He once commented that his own arichas yamim was to allow him the opportunity to raise his two sons. Indeed, he passed away at 100 years of age and merited to be a grandfather to their children as well.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">As a bachur, the niftar studied in Yeshivah Torah Vodaath and Bais Medrash Elyon, where his chavrusos included Harav Avraham Shia Heschel Bick and the Kaliver Rebbe of America. At a young age, he stood out for his great hasmadah and dedication to learning. Throughout his life, those who knew him marveled at his tremendous knowledge and clarity in Shas and Tanach.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 1958, he married Chana Leifer, daughter of Harav Naftali Leifer, zt&rdquo;l, and Rebbetzin Devorah, a&rdquo;h, a descendant of the Rebbes of Nadvorna and several other dynasties. Rav Leifer was known as the Volya Rav and led the Khal Chassidim shul in Boro Park for many years.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Upon his father&rsquo;s passing in 1989, the Rebbe reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership. As a young man, the niftar, in his typical humility, had expressed feelings of unworthiness at the prospect of succeeding his father. However, the previous Rebbe said outright that if his son refused to take over, he was prepared to close the beis medrash right there and then.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Understanding the great importance to his illustrious parent of the continuation of the Bluzhever legacy, he did all he could to keep alive the proud ways and minhagim of his father and the tzaddikim of previous generations.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Despite his great spiritual inheritance and erudition in Torah, the Rebbe carried himself with tremendous simplicity. His physical possessions were few and he did his utmost to fill his position as a servant of his flock.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">His emotional tefillos and niggunim stirred the hearts of those who merited hearing them. Many commented that on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, a dry eye could not be found in the beis medrash while the Rebbe was davening.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Even before his final illness, the Rebbe suffered from poor health for many years and lived with terrible physical suffering. He met his challenges with remarkable emunah and bitachon. The warm smile with which he greeted the many people who came to visit him did not betray the difficulty of his situation.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Above all, the Rebbe&rsquo;s legacy is one of complete dedication to others. He was always ready to listen to the problems of his fellow Jews, be they family, mispallelim or simply anyone who came to him seeking advice, chizuk or a brachah. In his signature self-effacing style, he once commented, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why people come to me. I do not have special maalos in Torah or tzidkus.

However, at the request of the Chofetz Chaim, Rav Shkop returned to Europe after six months. In 1939, the Soviet Red army marched into Grodno during the Asseres Yemei Teshuva. Most of the talmidim fled to Vilna, but Rav Shimon Shkop was too old and sick to travel and remained behind with a few talmidim. He passed away a month later. Rav Shimon Shkop was the author of Shaarei Yosher.</span></h2>",

The 14th of 14 children, 9 of whom died in childhood (while 3 others died in early adulthood). His mother, Serach, begged Hashem for a healthy son that would be a talmid chacham. Rav Uriel had a photographic memory and great analytic ability, despite having had only four years of structured schooling due to their refusal is accept him. He was home-schooled by his esteemed father Hacham Meir and attended the Chedder aka Mollaie and learned Persian writing and literature plus Arabic and Islamic law from his tutors, a sheikh and his wife! This came in handy later after the Iranian revolution and his dealings with Ayatollahs . Rav Uriel lost his father at 17, and married his first cousin at 18. Rav Uriel moved to Tehran at age 27 and became one of the two main rabbis of the city. He was an expert in Tanach &amp; Midrash, and edited and completed a Hebrew-Persian dictionary. He was an expert Mohel and taught in Otzar Hatorah schools for over 30 years. He officiated in all life cycle events but was most well-known and sought after for his vast knowledge,&nbsp; oratory skills and method of delivery.&nbsp; He had a large library and owned one of only three sets of Shas in Iran.&nbsp; He was personally responsible for saving several people from certain death by execution.&nbsp; When he left Iran in 1994, over one thousand Sefarim had to be left behind; only his Midrash Rabbah and Torah Temima he took to Israel.</span></h2>",

After his father was niftar in 1921, his six sons split the succession: Rav Moshe became rebbe in Stolin; Rav Avraham Elimelech took over in Karlin; Rav Yaakov moved to the U.S. in 1923 to lead the Karlin community in New York and Detroit. Rav Yochanan moved to Poland where he became a rebbe in Lutsk. Among the 41,000 people in Lutsk were 18,000 Jews. After the Nazis entered Lutsk on June 25, 1941, they herded the Jews into a ghetto in December, and the following August, they dragged 17,500 of them outside the town and gunned them down. Only about 150 Lutsk Jews survived the war. Rav Yochanan, his wife and two daughters fled into the surrounding forests and made their way deep into Russia with groups of partisans. After being deported to Siberia and personally burying his wife and elder daughter, Rav Yochanan somehow survived the war. Only one daughter, Faige, survived. He moved to Haifa in 1946, then to America two years later. While in New York, he founded the Karlin-Stolin Torah Institutions and published the new Siddur Beis Aharon v'Yisrael, comprising Karlin-Stolin minhagim.

      "subjectDescription": "<h1><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Meshulam Zusha</span></h1>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Meshulam Zusha (Rebbe Reb Zusha) ben Eleizer Lipa&nbsp; from Anapoli (Hanipol) (1718-1800). Disciple of Magid of Mezritch; younger brother of the Noam Elimelech.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><font color=\"#ffffff\">Reb Zusha was one of the most beloved stars in the constellation of the third generation of Chassidic masters. Humble and self-effacing, he is forever remembered in the many tales of his awe of G‑d and his deep love for His creations. Elder brother of Reb Elimelech of Lizhensk, and beloved pupil of Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezrich, Reb Zusha wrote no books and never amassed a large following. Yet, in his signature, understated way, he contributed greatly to the emerging Chassidic movement.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">1. His Father Had an Inn in a Small Village Near Tiktin</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">His exact date of birth is unknown, but it is believed that he is the son of Eliezer Lipa, a wealthy and learned innkeeper in a small village near Tiktin. Spiritually sensitive, he was attracted to the teachings of Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezrich, the primary student of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, founder of the Chassidic movement. Legends abound about how he influenced his brother, Elimelech, to become a chassid as well.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">2. His Mother Was Unlettered But Pious</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">Like most Jewish women of her era, Mirel, mother of Elimelech and Zusha, did not know how to read Hebrew. She was generous to a fault, and every Thursday she hired a driver to help her distribute funds to poor people, so that they would have something to eat on Shabbat. She was so modest that the driver never saw her face and never learned of her identity.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">3. He and His Brother Were In Self Imposed Exile</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">The two brothers wandered from place to place, without a penny in their pockets, forced to live by the kindness of strangers. This &ldquo;forced exile&rdquo; was not uncommon among spiritual seekers of the era who wished to cleanse their souls through suffering. In living a homeless life, they were emulating G‑d Himself, who has been without a &ldquo;home&rdquo; since the Temple was destroyed.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">For Reb Elimelech and Reb Zusha, however, there was another element. Traveling incognito, they were able to meet many people whom they would inspire to return to G‑d. Oftentimes, they would &ldquo;stage&rdquo; conversations in which R&rsquo; Elimelech would berate R&rsquo; Zusha for sins he supposedly committed. Hearing R&rsquo; Zusha&rsquo;s copious sobs, the listener would realize that he too had to repent for the very same sin.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">4. His Name Is Spelled Many Ways</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">His first name is Meshulam. His second name is sometimes written Zussman (this is how the Alter Rebbe and other contemporaries wrote it), Zushia, Zusia, Zisha, Zusil and Zusha. He is among the few Chassidic rebbes so venerated to be referred to as &ldquo;the Rebbe, Reb Zusha.&rdquo; There is ambiguity regarding his family name, as various immediate family members are known as Weisblum, Lipman, and Aurbach.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">5. He Learned a Lesson From Everything</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">A central tenet of Chassidic teaching is that everything can serve as a catalyst from which one can gain inspiration and insight into one&rsquo;s service of G‑d. Reb Zusha was known to learn seven lessons from a thief: a) He works quietly without others knowing. b) He is ready to place himself in danger. c) Even the smallest detail is of great importance to him. d) He labors with great toil. e) Alacrity. f) He is confident and optimistic. g) If he did not succeed the first time, he tries again and again.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">6. He Left Very Few Written Words</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin once explained (partially in jest) that the great Chassidic masters only shared what they had themselves learned from their teachers. Whenever Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezrich began to teach, Reb Zusha became so enraptured that he would scream &ldquo;ai, ai, ai&rdquo; with such excitement that the others would remove him from the lecture hall. Since Reb Zusha never heard, he never taught.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">Some of his teachings are posthumously collected in Menorat Zahav (Warsaw 1902) and Butzina Kadisha (Pietrykaw 1912).</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">7. His Peers Respected Him Greatly</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">The Alter Rebbe, known among the students of the Maggid as &ldquo;the Rav&rdquo; due to his erudition, had tremendous respect for Reb Zusha. When he was ready to print his new book, the Tanya, Reb Zusha was one of two people he asked to write an approbation.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">In recent years, a letter written by the Alter Rebbe was discovered. In it, he exhorts his followers to send donations to Reb Zusha along with their names so that &ldquo;their names be remembered before G‑d, who hears the voice of His servants&hellip;&rdquo;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">8. He Hid His Learning</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">Stories abound of Reb Zusha hiding the deepest teachings in simplistic words. Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber of Lubavitch related that several of the Maggid&rsquo;s students were once discussing the fine points of a particularly difficult passage in Maimonides&rsquo;s code (others say it was in the Zohar). Zusha approached them and asked what was bothering them, but they dismissed him, implying that it was above his level.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">Reb Zusha began to cry, &ldquo;Zusha doesn&rsquo;t understand this concept, oh, Zusha doesn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; until he fell asleep. When he awoke, he lucidly and clearly explained the concept to the two students who had previously dismissed him, having learned it in his sleep from Maimonides himself.</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">9. He Was Poor but Happy</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">A story is told about an individual who could not understand how to accept suffering with love. The Maggid sent the questioner to visit Reb Zusha, who was known to be destitute. &ldquo;I am not sure why you were sent to me,&rdquo; said Reb Zusha, &ldquo;What can I tell you about suffering? I have everything a person could possibly wish for!&rdquo;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">&nbsp;</font></h2>\r\n<h2><font color=\"#ffffff\">10.

The Rebbe demanded of his Chassidim that they pursue shleimus in every area of avodas Hashem.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When the Holocaust began, the Rebbe was aware of events and had the opportunity to escape to Eretz Yisrael, but refused.

The Nazis ordered everyone to leave, but the Rebbe was too weak, so he remained behind with his granddaughter Frieda. The commander ordered a soldier to go in and shoot the tzaddik, but the soldier rushed out of the bunker crying, &ldquo;He is a saint!&rdquo; Then the Nazis sent Jewish workers to carry the tzaddik out on pain of death. The Jewish workers removed the Rebbe from the bunker donned in his Shabbos attire carrying his tallis and tefillin, ready to perform the mitzvah of kiddush Hashem.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">From there the Rebbe and a large group of Jews were shipped to Auschwitz.

He dreamed of living with nature, planting, farming and connecting with the outdoors. The fact that his parents were Orthodox Jews did not really bother him. He needed his freedom. So at 17 he packed up and traveled thousands of miles to the Blackfeet Indian reservation in Montana. While there, he majored in wildlife biology at a local college and learned from teachers on the reservation. Later he joined another reservation in South Dakota. For years he plowed the soil, ate his own produce and lived on the land.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Continuing his quest for more knowledge, he heard about a woman living in Ogallala, South Dakota, the matriarch of the Sioux Indian Society, who possessed legendary insight. He decided that despite the trip &ndash; which would be across prairies and hills without road signs or even roads &ndash; he would make the journey.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">After two days of traveling alone, unsure if he was even heading in the right direction, he finally arrived. But when he approached the woman, she would not help him. &ldquo;You are not one of us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can never be like us, you don&rsquo;t belong here.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;But I have lived on reservations for years. I know your culture, I know your language, and I practice your customs. I feel part of&hellip;&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">She interrupted him. &ldquo;If you were Christian, I could understand. But you are a student of the Holy White Rock Man (which Ben later understood as a reference to &ldquo;When My Glory passes by, I shall put you (Moshe) in the cleft of the rock&rdquo; - Shemot 33:22). You are not one of us. Go back to your roots. That&rsquo;s where you belong.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Confused and dejected, Ben didn&rsquo;t know what to do. After all his travels, he was being told to go back to the same world he ran away from! He decided to listen to her and within days was back in New York. He asked around for anyone who could give him guidance.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The name Rav Shlomo Freifeld, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Shor Yashuv in Far Rockaway, NY came up. Ben drove out to the Yeshiva, tucked his ponytail under his shirt and made his way in. He was led to an office and began talking with Rabbi Freifeld. Rabbi Freifeld immediately began asking Ben about catching deer, identifying elk tracks and other mechanics of hunting. Though the conversation only lasted twenty minutes, the topics ranged from the Hungarian Navy to South Dakota Indian reservations.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The next morning when he returned, a large crowd was gathered in the Beit Midrash for a Bris Mila. Ben stood in back until Rabbi Freifeld noticed him and asked his son-in-law, Rabbi Avraham Halpern, to bring Ben to the front. Ben was touched that Rabbi Freifeld even recognized him, but wished he hadn&rsquo;t watched the actual procedure.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Over the next few weeks, they talked for hours on end. One time while they were sitting in the office, Rabbi Freifeld was called out for something. Left alone, Ben got up and began looking at all of the sefarim (Torah books). Then he noticed something unusual. There seemed to be some sefarim lying on the floor! These were holy books and surely didn&rsquo;t belong on the floor! He picked them up and saw that they were in fact not sefarim, but rather books about Indian culture and reservation! &ldquo;It was then,&rdquo; Ben says, &ldquo;that I realized how much my rebbe really loved me.&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Ben went on to study at Shor Yoshuv for years, where he saw first hand that Jews don&rsquo;t have to look anywhere else for the salvation and life we are all looking for.</span></h2>",

The next day, the first day of Rosh Hashana, the rumor spread through the whole camp that in the evening the youths would be taken to the furnace. Many people in the camp had an only son among these youths, the only child left to them ... and all that day they ran in confusion around the closed block, in the hope that perhaps they could catch some glimmer of light to save their precious son from there...</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">A simple Jew came and said to me: \"Rabbi! My only son is in there among the boys condemned to the furnace, and it is within my power to purchase his release. Since it is known to us, without any doubt, that they will take someone else in his place, I present before you a halachic decision. Tell me what the law is according to the Torah. Am I allowed to redeem him? I shall act according to your decision.\"</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When I heard this question, the thought of rendering a decision on the matter of life and death caused me to tremble. I replied: \"My dear friend, how can I give a clear-cut ruling on a question like this? When the Temple was standing, a question like this would have been brought before the Sanhedrin. And I am here in Auschwitz, without a single book of halacha (Jewish law), without other rabbis, and without a calm and settled mind, due to the many disasters and troubles. If it were the practice of these wicked ones to first release the redeemed one, and afterwards to take another in his place, there would be some room to lean toward a permissive [ruling]...\"</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">But the man wept greatly, and begged me very much. He said to me: \"Rabbi, you must tell me the halacha now.\" I in turn pleaded with him: \"Release me from this question, for I cannot tell you anything at all.\" But he continued to beg me, saying, \"Rabbi, does that mean that you do not permit me to redeem my only son? If so -- I accept the ruling with love.\"</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">I pleaded with him and objected to his inference, but he went on begging me and trying to make me give him a clear answer. When he saw that I stood my ground and did not want to give a halachic ruling, he answered me with emotion and with tremendous inspiration:</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">\"Rabbi, I have done my duty as the Torah requires me to do. I brought my question before the rabbi. There is no other rabbi here. If His Honor, the rabbi, cannot answer that it is permitted for me to redeem my child, that is a sign that he is not completely sure that the halacha permits [it]. If it were permissible without any doubts, certainly you would tell me so. To me this means that according to the halacha it is forbidden to me. I accept this with love and joy, and I shall not do anything to redeem him, because that is what the Torah commanded...\"</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">All my pleadings to him not to put the responsibility on me were to no avail. He only repeated what he had said, with heartrending weeping. He fulfilled his words, and did not redeem his son. That whole day, Rosh Hashana, he walked and spoke to himself joyfully, saying that he merited to sacrifice his only son to God, since even though it was in his power to redeem him, he would not, seeing that the Torah did not permit him to do such a thing. This would be considered by the Holy One, Blessed is He, like the Binding of our Father Isaac, which also had taken place on Rosh Hashana. (Cited in Ani Ma'amin, pp. 63-64. Another eye-witness account of this incident is recorded in Zichron Kedoshim, p. 380.).</span></h2>",

After the war, Rav Waltner and Rav Aryeh Grosnass traveled to Europe to help the shattered remnants of European Jewry, and founded the yeshiva in Sunderland to accommodate some of them. Traveling to Tangiers to recruit talmidim for Sunderland, he met Rav Shmuel Toledano who soon built a yeshiva building and then invited Rav Waltner to come and found a yeshiva. At the advice of Rav Dessler who consulted with the Chazon Ish on the matter, Rav Waltner accepted the challenge. There he set up a yeshiva called Eitz Chaim. There are thousands of bnei Torah and religious balabatim today who freely acknowledge that he is responsible for their spiritual life. He also established Otzar Hatorah institutions in Morocco.

Born in Bulgaria, he moved with his family to Eretz Yisrael when he was 3 years old. When he was 15, his father died. In the early 1840s, he was chosen as one of the &ldquo;shadarim&rdquo; (sheluchei de&rsquo;rabbanan) and sent to Northern Africa to collect funds for the yeshuv. Following stints in Morocco and Tunisia, he traveled to Italy. While there, he befriended the Pope, who offered to show him the Vatican&rsquo;s archives. There, he saw some of the sacred vessels that Titus had stolen from the Beis Hamikdash. The visit is described in his sefer, Lev Hamarpei. When he returned to Eretz Yisrael, he founded the Doresh Tzion Yeshiva in 1868 and was instrumental in helping to found the Tiferes Yerushalayim institutions. In 1881, he succeeded Rav Avraham Ashkenazi as Yerushalayim&rsquo;s Chief Sephardic Rabbi, the Rishom LeTzion.

He studied Kabbalah under the tutelage of Rabbi Ephraim Cohen and Rabbi Salman Eliyahu (father of former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu). After marrying his first wife, Sarah, HaRav Kadouri lived in Shechunat Habucharim, one of Jerusalem's first neighborhoods built outside the Old City walls. He would stay at the yeshiva all week, coming home shortly before Shabbos. Following the petira of Rav Ephraim Hakohen, head of Jerusalem's mekubalim, toward the end of 1949, Rav Kadouri was selected to head the group. He found a new institution called Yeshivat Nachalat Yitzchak. Graced with a phenomenal memory, he was said to have known the entire Babylonian Talmud by heart. His closer students say that the blessing of the Ben Ish Chai and that of the Lubavitcher Rebbe - both of whom blessed him that he might live to see the Final Redeemer - came true. The students say that Rabbi Kaduri told them he met the Messiah on Cheshvan 9, 5764 (Nov. 4, 2003). He reportedly said that the Messiah is not promoting himself, and that a study of his [Rabbi Kaduri's] words in recent months would provide hints of his identity.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

In Av Be'chochmah, he defends what was probably his best-known and most controversial ruling, that the chalitzah act could be performed al yedei shli&rsquo;ach. Among those who opposed his ruling were Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer and the Rogatchover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Born in Goray, near Lublin, Poland, Rav Menachem Mendel received a thorough Torah education from his father. After his marriage at 14, he was introduced to the world of Chassidus. Thereafter, he became an ardent follower of the Chozeh of Lublin and Rav Simcha Bunam of Pshis'cha, whom he eventually succeeded. Rav Menachem Mendel was a new type of chassid. If the Baal Shem Tov embodied chessed, Reb Mendel represented din. While the Baal Shem sought to reach all the people, Reb Mendel knew that what he sought could only be attained by the elite. The Baal Shem lifted the people up, Reb Mendel rebuked them for their inadequacies and always demanded more. Reb Leibel Eiger was entranced by Kotzk, to the despair of his father, Rav Shlomo. Reb Mendel and Reb Mordechai Yosef of Ishbitz had been close friends and disciples of Reb Simcha Bunim of P&rsquo;shischa.&nbsp; After Reb Bunim&rsquo;s passing, Reb Mendel became Rebbe.&nbsp; However, because of Reb Mendel&rsquo;s extreme aloofness the two friends split, and the Izhbitzer left with his chassidim to form a new chassidus. Most prominent among the Kotzker&rsquo;s students were the Chidushei Harim of Ger and Rav Chanoch of Alexander.<br /><br /></span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">The Kotzker was an immensely influential figure in 19th century Polish Hasidism. He was a central actor in a reforming movement within Hasidism, seeking to shake up the now-popular movement and purge its overly easy emotionalism and ostentatious piety. He demanded uncompromising honesty and self-scrutiny. He and his followers did not play well with others, displaying unconventional behavior and showing no deference to authority. Ultimately, his story turned tragic, as he was overcome by what looks &ndash; from modern perspective &ndash; like mental illness. Instead of bringing the Messiah, he ended his life as a recluse, with only a few remaining Hasidim, most of the others having followed his students R. Mordecai Leiner of Ishbitz and R. Itzhak Meir of Ger.</font></span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">But in his day, the Kotzker was a brilliant and inspiring teacher. One of his best sayings was on this week&rsquo;s reading, Parshat Mishpatim. After prohibiting Jews to eat carrion &ndash; the specific meaning of the word treyf means carrion, or &ldquo;road kill&rdquo; &ndash; the Torah [Exodus 22.30] exhorts &ldquo;you shall be holy people &ndash;אנשי קודש &ndash; to me.&rdquo; With a dash of word play, the Kotzker rephrased this as: &ldquo;you have to be holy in a human way.&rdquo; God has plenty of angels. Don&rsquo;t try to be a disembodied spirit.</font></span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">The Torah&rsquo;s true plan and the goal for the commandment is to take us in all our humanness, with all our temptations and struggles, and to ennoble us as people. It is easy to see how this teaching applies to the specific context regarding Kashrut, as in the parasha: you must eat, but do not eat like a vulture or a rat. Refine eating into a reflective, dignified, sacred act.</font></span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">And it applies throughout life, in all Jewish practices and in all human interactions.

Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, he learned at Yeshiva Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin and became a talmid muvhak to Rav Yitzchok Hutner. In 1952, he headed an afternoon talmud Torah in New York, while serving as Rav of his shul, Bnai Israel. His focus at the talmud Torah was to convince the youngsters to attend yeshiva. When throngs of Russian immigrants began to reach American shores, gedolei Yisroel, led by Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky, insisted that we, as a community, must act. When Be&rsquo;er Hagolah was originally established, Rav German was a part of the vaad hachinuch, along with Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky, Rav Shneur Kotler, Rav Elya Svei, Rav Aharon Schechter and the Novominsker Rebbe. Rav German threw himself into helping the school. Their leadership completely turned the school around, transforming it into a most formidable force in Russian education. Rav German arrived in Starret City in the 1970s, when there was barely a minyan of shomer Shabbos Jews there. Today, it is a thriving community. Not only that, but his shul, Bnai Israel of Starret City, is the only shul in the entire area. The Germans&rsquo; kiruv efforts, both in shul and school, were legendary. On Pesach, they would conduct a Seder for hundreds of Russian Jews.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

In 1977, his first book &ndash; &ldquo;Anvil of Sinai,&rdquo; was published. Patterned on Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch's classic The Nineteen Letters, he sought to address the basic questions of faith of any searching young person. Over the next three decades, he authored nearly twenty books - six volumes on the mesorah of Torah, works aimed at providing an entire Torah world view, books on mussar and ethics, on the Chagim, on Chumash, all written in clear, crisp English. Each work was a collaborative effort with his wife Chava, who transcribed his hand-written pages into type. A New York City public school teacher decided to use Rav Fendel's &ldquo;From Dusk to Dawn&rdquo; to teach the Holocaust to a class drawn from 25 different nations around the globe. Despite the book's \"Jewish, G-d-centered point of view, unapologetic to a hostile world,\" the students read the book \"with passion and heart. . . the words of a rabbi resonat[ing] like the word of G-d he truly represented to them.\"</span></h2>",

He was the leader of the aliya of the followers of the Vilna Gaon to Eretz Yisrael. This is significant because of the many Minhagei Yerushalayim that were established by that Ashkenazi community. Rav Menachem Mendel was chosen by the Vilna Gaon to commit the latter's chiddushim to writing.&nbsp; His leading student, Yitzchak Eizak Chaver Wildmann (1789-1853), perceived that the obscurity of the kabbalistic system was a major factor in the flight of students and thinkers from Torah to science, secular philosophy and atheism. In Pischey She'arim, R. Yitzchak Eizak Chaver vindicates the kabbalah against its detractors, showing that behind its metaphors lies the only system with the power to provide satisfying answers to man's deepest questions about the meaning and purpose of the universe. The sefer Mishlei with the commentary of the Gra, acclaimed and accepted by Jewry worldwide, was written solely by his talmid R' Mendel of Shklov. However, R' Mendel admits that not all the peirushim are exactly as the Gra told him. \"There are some things that I understood from the Gaon's hints and (after writing them) I asked if I had expressed his opinion, and he nodded his head to me.\" Rav Menachem Mendel wrote a commentary on Sefer HaPeliah.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

He was a holocaust survivor who left behind many wonderful memories that we can learn from and cherish. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The following is an extract from the hesped given by his son, Yitzchok Berkovits, on Cheshvan 2: Thanks to all that are here for coming... it means so much that you are able to be mekaym this Mitzvah with us and give your last respects. Our family would like to express our Hakaras Hatov to the following:&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rabbi Friedman for all the support the rav has given my father on his last few months in Olam Haze, they are too many to count. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Special thanks to the Ehrman &amp; Grimberg family, through the years they have always been there to open their homes, sukkahs, for us and so much more when we came to visit my father. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">To the Fatu family for the non stop love and daily care they gave to our father, day in and day out. As difficult as things were, they kept giving their full heart during the hardest of times. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The Wizgan family - non stop caring and spending so much time with my father as things became tougher and tougher. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">I also want to express my Hakaras Hatov to Avraham Yechiel Hirschman who was there daily the last few months, involved with Bikur Cholim and Ateres Avigail, for putting Teffilin on my father, when I was not around to do it. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">And to a very special Shaliach - Raanan Wizgan, who was able to be with my father during the last minutes of his life. Some how, some way, against all odds, where Ceders Sanai hospital only allows 1 person per 24 hours to visit due to Covid, he got permission for 2. This allowed my dear cousin Raanan to be there as my father departed to Olam HaEmes. I also was able to enter the room 50 minutes after he passed (my plane landed at LAX at the exact moment he was niftar). </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">My father was born in Kolozs, Klausenburg and was zoche to grow up in a fruma yidddshe home through the age of 12, then was sadly taken to Auschwitz. He survived 2 years of Auschwitz, but he no longer had parents and lost 2 of his sisters. However 6 remaining siblings survived. He married my mother and accepted her 3 children, raised them, loved them unconditionally, and gave them all he had...to raise them as if they were his own. He did not distinguish one bit of difference between his own kids and my mother&rsquo;s children from a previous marriage. All of us were treated 100% equal. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When I was 17 years old we lost our mother to a horrible tragedy. It was very hard for us all, especially my sister Shirley.... but he never gave up raising us and providing for all that we needed, as challenging as the times were. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">My father understood and appreciated what a family is all about. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He wanted to build a family again so he accepted a whole new family into his life, once again kids without a father. He gave them his whole heart and raised them giving them a feeling of being part of a big family. He would make all his kids feel even and equal, giving them the feeling of having a father and being part of a family. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">My father was Ohev Chesed and Rodef Shalom. He would hate when people fought and always ran to make Shalom between them... no matter what it took, he would make every possible hishtadlus to make peace. His heart was filled with unlimited kindness. He understood what a Yesom was and he always gave the love and the emotional and physical support they needed. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">If anyone approached him for help, he would never say no. He gave himself for others, no matter WHO THEY WERE, even when an organizations asked him to work 12 hour shifts just to meet their expectations, he did without uttering a complaint. He was a very humble man who never asked for anything above the basics. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">My father always made sure to tell me how proud he was of us and all of his grandkids. He was happy with all his heart to see them go in the way of Hashem. Yiddishkite was hard for him after coming out of Aushwitz as a yesom. At the same time he had amazing Ahavas yisroel and always gave kavod to everyone around him. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">About 14 years ago we went to Rav Sofronovitz to get my father Teffilin once again .... he asked the rav if he is required to wrap them up every day when he is done with them. I jumped in like a fool and said &ldquo;Of course Aba, we need to give them kavod&rdquo;. Rav Sofronovitz turned to me and smiled and said &ldquo;Do you know why he is asking ? Because he wants to put them on EVERY DAY, and sees no purpose in putting them away&rdquo;... and so he did just that from then until his last day in this world. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He always made small steps and never rejected anything when it came to Yiddishkite.....it was just a very hard thing, because of what he saw and experienced in Auschwitz. He was always sure to remind me how happy he was that we continued the Yiddishkite he lost, and he so yearned for. He always said \"You are continuing what my father would have wished for, and what Hitler im&rdquo;s took from many of us, don't ever let go....\" </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">A couple of months ago, when we sat in the hospital, he took upon himself TESHUVA SHELEYMA from his heart. I remember he told me with anger &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I do this before, why now that I am on my death bed.&rdquo; It really upset him, mamash Tshuva shel Ahavah mikol libo! This is how he chose to end his life in Olam Hazeh, prepared and ready for Olam HaEmes.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The night before my flight here, while my dad was still alive, my son Yakov whose bar mitzvah is in 30 days iy\"H, said he had a great idea... I asked him what is it ? He said &ldquo;Tatte, right we learned that one who benches the levana is promised to live out that entire month? So before you fly back home, bench the levana with Saba.&rdquo; I told him that was great idea but he has to actually see the levana and he can&rsquo;t go outside due to his condition. Yakov went to sleep with a sad look on his face. The next morning before my flight here, Yaakov told me with excitement and a happy lively look on his face not to worry he had a dream about Saba and in his hospital bed right behind him was a window and the moon was shining through. All he would have to do is turn his head and he could bench the levana. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">We didn&rsquo;t make it to bench the levana Yakov..... but you and I will, for the rest of our lives, with Saba in mind........ </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">...&lrm;תהא נשמתו צרורה בצרור החיים&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Rav Chaim moved to Warsaw, making it his home for the next 80 years. When Hoffmann, the chief Prussian administrator of Warsaw, insisted that every Jew adopt a surname for use on official documents in 1795, Reb Chaim took the name Davidson, in honor of his father. In addition to studying at the yeshiva of the Nesivos in Lissa, Rav Chaim often visited and studied with Rabbi Akiva Eiger. In the early 1800s, the Jewish population of Warsaw was skyrocketing, largely because of refugees coming in from the Ukraine and other places. From 2,519 Jews in 1765, the Jewish presence shot up to 15,000 by 1816. In 1802, the maskilim were numerous enough to open their own shul, which they named the \"German Synagogue.\" After 1815 when Russia annexed Warsaw, a deadly partnership developed between the autonomous Polish government and Haskala Jews. An edict in 1821 decreed the abolition of the kehillos, and substituted them with \"Congregational Boards\" consisting of the rav, his assistant, and three trustees. In 1822, Rav Chaim was chosen as one of Warsaw's three trustees and held this position for two years. After the passing of the Chemdas Shlomo in 1839, a council appointed Rav Chaim to be the new Rav of Warsaw. Thereafter, his wealthy son, Rav Naftali, supplied him with funds to continue the numerous chesed projects he had financed while he himself was a wealthy man.</span></h2>",

In it, he gathered the opinions and decisions of all the major authorities up until his time and cross-referenced them. He ruled between differing views on the basis of a consensus between the three preeminent halachic authorities, the Rif, the Rambam, and the Rosh. The work was completed in 1542, but he continued to refine it for the next 12 years, and published a second edition. After he had completed the Beis Yosef, Rav Caro made a summary of his rulings in the form of an index without reference to sources and titled it Shulchan Aruch (\"Laid Table\"). It was completed in 1555 in Israel; it was first published in Venice in 1565. Eventually, the Rama's gloss (called HaMapa -- \"The Tablecloth\") was published together with the Shulchan Aruch in Cracow in 1578, and together they became the universally recognized Code of Jewish Law. The Rambam had published his Mishna Torah without references for his rulings. The Maggid Mishna, a commentary on Mishneh Torah written by Rabbi Vidal di Tolouse, had referenced six of the fourteen sections of the work, and Rav Caro set out to complete the references, while at the same time explaining the Rambam's view and defending it from the Raavad.

Uneasy about associating himself with Zionism, he urged that it confine itself to political and economic activity, and that if it did deal with religious matters it should at least be under rabbinic supervision. When his proposal was rejected, he launched a vehement attack against the Zionist Movement. Thereafter he became one of the leading opponents of Zionism. From 1901 to 1905 he edited Ha-Peles and from 1910 to 1914 Ha-Modi&rsquo;a which were the main vehicles for his polemics. In 1912 Rav Rabinowitz participated in the founding conference of the Agudath Israel in Kattowice. Among his literary works were Chesed LeMeshicho, a commentary on the Book of Ruth.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

When he was 11 his father brought him to Volozhin to learn under his uncle, Rav Itzeleh, the Rosh Yeshiva and son of Rav Chaim of Volozhin. After his marriage, his father-in-law supported him for thirteen years. In 1849, Rav Itzeleh of Volozhin passed away. Less than four years later, his successor, Rav Eliezer Yitzchak Fried also passed away. The Rabbanim decided that two descendants of Rav Chaim of Volozhin, the Netziv and the Beis Haleivi, would lead the yeshiva. The Netziv would be Rosh Yeshiva and the Beis Haleivi would be assistant Rosh Yeshiva.The sefer Beis Haleivi is comprised primarily from the shiurim he gave in Volozhin. His derech halimud was something that was completely new and original to the Volozhiner Yeshiva and was very different from the traditional way that shiurim were given there. His sefer Beis Haleivi was published in 1863. In 1865, a delegation from the city of Slutzk came to the Beis Haleivi to present him with a ksav rabbanus that was signed by all of the respected members of the community and recommended by Rav Yitzchak Elchonon Spektor, the Kovno Rav. The Beis Haleivi served as Rav of Slutzk for close to ten years, but his unbending battle against the maskilim and the wealthy eventually forced him from the city. In 1865, a delegation from Brisk came to him and offered him the position of Rav to replace Rav Yehoshua Leib Diskin who had just moved to Eretz Yisrael. The Beis Haleivi served as Rav in Brisk for 17 years until his passing.</span></h2>",

Born in Padua, Italy, the Ramchal was a student of Rabbi Yitzchak Lampronti, author of the Pachad Yitzchak, the first major Talmudic encyclopedia ever assembled. The novelty of his approach drew opposition from a number of his contemporaries. Partially as a result of this opposition, Luzzatto left his native Italy in 1735 and settled in Amsterdam. In 1743, he traveled to Eretz Israel and settled in Acco. He died in a plague only four years later, along with his wife and his son. The Vilna Gaon declared that the Ramchal had the most profound understanding of Yiddishkeit that any mortal human could attain. He furthermore stated that if Luzzatto were alive in his generation, he would go by foot from Vilna to Italy to sit at his feet and learn from him. According to a mesorah, the Gaon was going to Eretz Yisrael to be a talmid of the Ramchal but then found out that the Ramchal was niftar so he returned to Vilna. There is an interesting mesorah that the Ramchal was a gilgul of Rebbe Akiva. The two are buried right next to each other and the Ramchal was niftar when he was 40; it is said to make up for the first 40 years of Rebbe Akiva&rsquo;s life, prior to his doing teshuva.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

In 1592 the Maharal accepted the position of rabbi in Posen, returning to Prague in 1598 to serve as its chief rabbi. The Maharal castigated the educational methods of his day where boys were taught at a very young age and insisted that children must be taught in accordance with their intellectual maturity. One of his leading disciples was R. Yom Tov Heller, author of the classic mishnaic commentary, Tosafos Yom Tov, who, in his introduction informs us that the Maharal greatly encouraged group study of the Mishna. At the same time, he was fully conversant with the scientific knowledge of his time as well as friendly with some of the contemporary eminent scientists. His disciple, Dovid Ganz, worked in the observatory of Tycho Brahe, the distinguished astronomer. He was a prolific writer, and his works include: Tiferes Yisrael on the greatness of Torah and mitzvos; Nesivos Olam, on ethics; Be'er Hagolah, a commentary on rabbinic sayings; Netzach Yisrael, on exile and redemption; Or Chadash, on the book of Esther; Ner Mitzvah, on Chanukah; Gevuros Hashem, on the Exodus; and many others.

Prior to his Bar Mitzvah, he followed an older brother to Telz. His Rebbi muvhak was Harav Chaim Rabinowitz, known as Reb Chaim Telsher. In October 1940 a group of Telz students, led by Rav Stein, escaped from Lithuania just ahead of the Nazis, ultimately ending up in Cleveland where they formed the nucleus of a reestablished Telz Yeshiva. They were among the beneficiaries of Chiune Sugihara, who, as Japanese consul in Lithuania provided transit visas to desperate Jews and others seeking to escape arrest by the Nazis. Most of the Telz faculty and students who stayed behind were killed by the Nazis. Reb Chaim had an intensive learning seder in seder Kodashim, finishing Zevachim 13 times before he turned 16. Rav Stein left two sons (Rav Shmuel Zalman Stein, a Rosh Yeshiva in Yeshiva Birchas Chaim in Lakewood, and Rav Binyamin Moshe Stein who lives in Wickliffe,OH) and two daughters (one married to Rav Menachem Levine in Telze and the other, Tzipporah, is married to Rav Matis Weinberg).</span></h2>",

The Sultan of Morocco, Sidi Mohammed, closed down the port of Agadir, replacing it with the new port of Mogador (or Essaquira) that he had completed 1765, far south on Morocco's west coast. Mogador's thriving businesses were jumpstarted by thirteen businessmen known as the toujiar el Sultan (the traders of the Sultan) - ten of them Jews and three of them Moslems - and thanks to them and others, Mogador helped open Morocco to Europe. Within twenty years, the Mogador Jews would comprise half or more of the town's 6,000 residents. Young Chaim moved to Mogador and learned in the yeshiva headed by the av beis din, Rav Yaakov Bibas.

It was Rav Menachem Mendel who first adopted the family name, &ldquo;Hager,&rdquo; which still prevails in the Vizhnitz dynasty, an offshoot of the Kossov court. Kossov is a town that lies at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, in East Galicia, near the confluence of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania. Jews had lived there since the fifteenth century at least. Rav Menachem Mendel&rsquo;s grandson, Rav Yaakov Shimshon, married at the age of 15, but had remained childless for about thirty-two years, remarrying twice during that time. Then, Rav Moshe born. Rav Yaakov Shimshon passed in 1880, when his son, Moshe, was only 20. One year later, he took his post as Rebbe. Rav Moshe was succeeded by his son, Rav Chaim, who ultimately was murdered in the Holocaust. After the war, the Kossov dynasty was continued in Boro Park by a son of Rav Moshe&rsquo;s daughter, Rav Avraham Yehoshua Heschel.</span></h2>",

He was nurtured by his mentors, the Chozeh of Lublin and Rav Shlomo Lutzker, the Divras Shlomo. In 1817, he was appointed Rav of Belz, and he in 1843, the famed Belz Beis Hamedrash was completed. (It was entirely destroyed during World War II, but a replica was built in Yerushalayim years later). Among his early students was Rav Shlomo Kluger of Brody. Since the beginnings of the movement, the misnagdim had accused chasidim of devoting too much time to joyous celebrations in fellowship with their rebbes, at the expense of Torah study. By stressing the overriding importance of in-depth Torah study, the Belzer Rebbe removed the stigma of superficiality that had plagued Chasidism. He was succeeded by his son, Rav Yehoshua. In the 1940s, the Nazis all but wiped out the splendor that was Belz. After the war, the remnants of Belzer Chasidus - under the leadership of the surviving scion of the Belz dynasty, the young Rabbi Yissachar Dov - miraculously restored the former grandeur of Belz. Today the glorious new Belzer yeshiva building graces the Jerusalem skyline. Some of his teachings are recorded in the sefer, Dover Shalom.</span></h2>",

Known as the Sheva-Chaim of Sanz, he was a great-grandson of the Divrei Chaim of Sanz. He spent most of World War II in concentration camps. During his last 15 years of life, he founded Kollelei Shas in Eretz Yisrael and America. These Kollelei Shas were intended for premier avreichim who were already known for their sharp intellect and hasmada. The goal of the kollel was that in the course of three years, the members had to complete the entire Shas. Every member had to obligate himself to be tested on 75 blatt Gemara with Tosafos each month and know them by heart! Then, in 1983, at his house in Kiryat Sanz, Netanya, he laid the cornerstone for what would ultimately become Mifal HaShas, where avreichim would learn 30 blatt of Gemara with Tosafos with a built-in review program and be tested monthly on the material learned. In addition to his tremendous efforts on behalf of Torah learning, the Rebbe also used his experiences from the war to stimulate him in another area. Having survived the horror of witnessing the murder of his wife and their 11 children, Reb Yekusiel vowed to dedicate his life to welfare and good health of all Jewish children. He founded Laniado Hospital in Netanya in 1975 after 15 years of fund-raising. His vision of a proper Jewish hospital was confirmed in 1990, as it was one of the only hospitals in Israel to have every employee working during the 127-day doctors&rsquo; strike. After his petira, his eldest surviving son, Rav Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, became the new Sanz Rebbe in Israel, as well as President of the Hospital.</span></h2>",

The first chief rabbi of what was then Palestine, Rav Kook was perhaps the most misunderstood figure of his time. Born in Latvia of staunch Chassidic and Misnagid stock, he retained throughout his life a unique blend of the mystical and the rational. He was a thorough master of the entire Halachic, Midrashic, philosophic, ethical, and Kabbalistic literature. He saw the return to Eretz Yisrael as not merely a political phenomenon to save Jews from persecution, but an event of extraordinary historical and theological significance. Rabbi Hutner once said that Rav Kook peered down on our world from great heights and hence his perspective was unique. Above all, Rav Kook pulsated with a sense of the Divine. Though keenly aware of the huge numbers of non-observant Jews, he had a vision of the repentance of the nation. His concept of repentance envisioned in addition to the repentance of the individual, a repentance of the nation as a whole; a repentance which would be joyous and healing. He refused to reject Jews as long as they identified themselves as Jews. He called for and envisioned a spiritual renaissance where \"the ancient would be renewed and the new would be sanctified.\"</span></h2>",

The first maskilim settled in Chernovitz at the start of the 19th century, and their influence had grown so fast that, by 1849, they controlled the Board of the Jewish community. It was in Chernowitz that secular Yiddishism held a major convocation and proclaimed Yiddish as the Jewish national language in1908. After Rav Yitzchak Eizik married his wife, Chanah, his father asked him to preside as Rav and Admor in the town of Vashkowitz. Two years later, he moved to Zutchka where he remained until World War II. Soon after the war, Rav Yitzchak Eizik moved to Boro Park.

He was about 50 years old. An unmarried man of solitary habits, he was highly respected in the community for his righteousness. His days were spent entirely in study and prayer. Thirty years after he had come to live in Cracow something occurred which was to change his whole way of&nbsp; life. A young merchant was murdered and left behind him childless widow. At that period of time Rabbi Yosef Yozpa was studying Torah with Eliyahu HaNavie (Elijah the Prophet). Upon the decease of that woman's husband, Eliyahu HaNavie told R' Yosef that he was to marry her in order to bring to earth a certain pure soul whose task will be to help all Jews. Six months passed by, one day&nbsp; R' Yosef appeared before the rabbinical court and announced his intension of marrying the young widow. They sent a messenger to fetch her. When she came she burst into tears of relief. When forced to explain, she told of a dream that recurred several times. Her deceased father had come to her in his shabbat apparel, had blessed her and commanded her to marry Rabbi Yosef. Now when she heard that he was prepared to marry her she was overjoyed. The entire community rejoiced and came came to participate in the wedding. After a year they were blessed with a son whom they named Eliyahu after Eliyahu HaNavie.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">At the age of two, the boy was already learning Torah with his father. His father taught him until the age of Bar Mitzva, in holiness and seclusion from mundane matters. Two weeks before the boy's Bar Mitzva the father called his wife and told her that he has to return his soul to The Creator. He asked her not to cry or mourn over him too much. She must permit their son to follow the path he pleased without interference.&nbsp; Rabbi Yosef Yozpa died. Several weeks after his Bar Mitzva, young Eliyahu told his mother that he wished to leave home and wonder. She agreed to let him go.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">During the next 40 years, no one knew of Eliyahu, where he was or what he did. When he settled in Worms, Germany, he was already famous as Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem. He came to Worms accompanied by his wife. They had already married off their son and two daughters. R' Eliyahu had gained fame as a performer of wonders and now people streamed to him to find balm for their troubles.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rabbi Eliyahu possessed a most brilliant mind, capable of absorbing the mystical knowledge that flowed from the Holy Zohar, Ari HaKadosh and R' Moshe Cordovero. At the tender age of 13 he was already master of the study of Kabbala. Gifted with a logical mind, he also possessed the power of clarification and of oratory. He began popularizing the study of Kabbalah among Torah scholars, and thanks to him, it soon became an accepted subject among the other Yeshivot of those times (Worms, Prague, Lublin, and Chelm). He efforts in spreading Kabbalah was met by opposition from some rabbis. In order to spread Kabbalah even further R' Eliyahu formed a group of Nistarim&nbsp; - tzaddikim who remained anonymous. They were to wander from place to place, to penetrate to the simple folk in the nation and encourage them to do good deeds in service of Hashem, while simultaneously working upon the learned people to introduce the study of Kabbalah to them.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The circle of&nbsp; Nistarim expanded further and further under R' Eliyahu's leadrship. He later transferred the leadership of&nbsp; his philosophy to the Baal Shem of Zamoshtesh who in return transmitted it to Reb Adam Baal Shem of Ropshitz. It was from Reb Adam that this philosophy came to Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, who then spread Chassidut.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">R' Eliyahu resided in Worms for 30 years, where he led a yeshiva of brilliant and renowned scholars.

Not long afterwards, in 1918, the community there appointed Rav Ashkenazi as their rabbi. After seven years, he moved to assist the small Jewish community in Shanghai, China. Deteriorating conditions in Europe in the 1930's led to a slow stream of German, Austrian, and Russian Jews into the Far East, which increased considerably at the outbreak of the Second World War. By the end of 1941, there were 18,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai, ten times the number of Jews in Shanghai just ten years earlier.</span></h2>",

Abrabanel was born in Lisbon, Portugal, to an illustrious Sephardic family which traced its lineage back to Dovid Hamelech. His grandfather, Rav Shmuel, escaped from Seville, Spain, when the Catolics destroyed the Jewish quarter, mudering many Jews. When Rav Yitzchak was only 20, he completed his first book, Ateres Zekeinim, and began to work on his famous commentary on the Torah. In the Summer of 1471, following the victory of King Alfonso V over Morocco, an emissary of the Moroccan Jewish community, Emmanuel ben Yitzchak, approached Don Yitzchak Abrabanel with a plea to assist in the ransom of 250 Jewish would-be slaves. The Abarbavnl was not only successful, he added his own funds to supply food and medicine. Abarbanel served as treasurer to King Alfonso until he was forced to move to Castile (Spain) and eventually entered the service of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1484. In March 1492, an edict was issued expelling the Jews from Spain, after the conquest of Granade. Despite his political influence he was unable to prevent the expulsion in 1492 and refused the king&rsquo;s offer to remain at his post, choosing instead to throw in his lot with his people. On Tisha B&rsquo;Av, he led 300,000 Jews out of the country. Only 10% reached safe shores. Rav Yitzchak found asylum in Naples, where he remained for seven years, until the French invaded. He then fled to Corfu and finally &ndash; in 1503 - to Venice, where he died. Most of his writings were composed in his later years when he was free of governmental responsibilities.</span></h2>",

In 1921, Lublin had a population of 37,337 Jews, comprising over a third of its population. The Lubliner heritage was continued by Rav Shlomo's cousin, Rav Avraham Eiger, who established his court in Bnei Brak and passed away in 2000.</span></h2>",

His job was to help the inmates with their immediate needs. He asked Novardoker Rav Gershon Liebman, &ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;To establish a yeshivah!&rdquo; Rav Gershon exclaimed.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The soldier hadn&rsquo;t been expecting such a forceful answer, and hadn&rsquo;t heard such a request before.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; said Rav Gershon.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;And who will be the leader of this yeshivah?&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;And who will be the students?&rdquo;</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;I will be the student!&rdquo; Rav Gershon said.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;What else do you want?&rdquo; asked the American.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Rav Gershon.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">As far as the officer could tell, Rav Gershon had become unhinged by his sufferings. He left him and made no effort to fulfill his request. Still, on his own initiative, Rav Gershon announced the opening of a yeshivah in Bergen-Belsen. He was the rosh yeshivah and he let it be known that anyone who wanted to learn could join him. He found an old synagogue in Hanover with a full set of Mishnayos. He soon had over a hundred students.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 1948, Rav Gershon set out for France. He had no family and no money, but what he did have was a burning desire to educate a new generation of Jews. And so, although he couldn&rsquo;t speak a word of French, he decided to open a yeshivah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">After two weeks in Paris, Rav Gershon heard about the Jewish community in Morocco, although by that time most of the children were attending the nonreligious Alliance schools. Rav Gershon gathered the young sons of families who still wanted to see their children study Torah, and they were joined by boys from Algiers and Tunisia. He took them to Lyon, France, and opened a yeshivah without even the most basic essentials &mdash; no classrooms, no books, no counselors, and no teachers. But despite the spartan conditions, their hearts were open and they absorbed Novardok-style mussar from this rabbi who couldn&rsquo;t speak their language.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">The yeshivah, called Ohr Yosef, moved from place to place, and soon the students began teaching Torah to others. Rav Gershon was eventually instrumental in establishing dozens of Jewish institutions, from elementary schools to old-age homes, all over France.</span></h2>",

In 1619, a cholera epidemic broke out, and he moved to Yerushalayim, then back to Chevron, and eventually, to Azah (Gaza). It was in Azah that he wrote Chessed L'Avraham.

These were all lost at sea during a storm. In Chevron, Rav Avraham wrote his major work on Kabbalah, entitled Kiryat Arba. It is based on the teachings of the four great kabbalists: the Ramak, the Arizal, Rav Chaim Vital and Rav Avraham Galanti. Later, in Aza (Gaza), Rav Avraham composed three more sefarim: Baalei Bris Avraham, a commentary on the twenty-four books of the Tanach, and Chessed l'Avraham, which contains kabbalistic drashos.

Born to the Rebbe of Prohibisht (who was a son of Reb Avraham HaMalach, the son of the Maggid of Mezerich). He was engaged to the Rav of Berditchev at the age of seven; six years later, the chasuna took place. When Reb Yisrael turned sixteen his older brother, Reb Avraham (who had succeeded their father), was niftar, leaving no children. He was then succeeded by Reb Yisrael. When word reached the Rebbe that the Russian Czar intended to build a big church in the Old City of Yerushalayim, the Rebbe summoned Reb Nisan Bak who lived in Yerushalayim. Reb Nisan arrived there a few days ahead of the Russians and succeeded in buying the plot of land. The Czar was forced to buy a different plot of land, known today as the Russian Compound. The shul was known as the \"Reb Nisan Bak Shul\" and stood until 1948 when it was destroyed by the Arabs. Following the orders of the Czar, the Rebbe was locked up in the Kiev dungeons. The Rebbe spent 22 months locked in a small dark and damp cellar. A few days after the Rebbe was freed he fled Russia and settled in the town of Sadiger. The Rebbe's derech was carried on through his six sons. The Rebbe's oldest son, Reb Shalom Yosef, was niftar less than a year after his father and was succeeded by his son Reb Yitzchak, who became the first Bohusher Rebbe. The Ruzhiner's second son, Reb Avraham Yaakov, took his father's place in Sadiger. He had two sons, the eldest, Reb Yitzchak, was the first Boyaner Rebbe and the younger son, Reb Yisrael, was rebbe in Sadiger. The third son of the Ruzhiner was Reb Dov Ber who was rebbe in Lieov and the fourth son, Reb Menachem Nachum, was rebbe in Sthefanesht. The fifth son was Reb Dovid Moshe, the Chortkover Rebbe, and the sixth son was Reb Mordechai Shraga, the Husyatiner Rebbe. The Ruzhiner also had four daughters. The third daughter, Miriam, was married to Reb Menachem Mendel of Vishnitz, founder of the Vishnitzer dynasty.&nbsp;</span></h2>",

Like many towns in this region, the town switched nationalities periodically during its history, starting off as a Ukrainian village before becoming part of Galicia. In the 14th century Drohobitch became Polish when King Kazimierz annexed Galicia to Poland. Then Austria seized the town in 1772 during a partition of Poland. Poland grabbed it back for 20 years just before World War II and, today it is once more under Ukrainian control, minus its Jewish population. In 1939 Drohobitch had about 10,000 Poles, 10,000 Ukrainians and 15,000 Jews. [Hamodia 2006, 2009 says 1744, and noted that &ldquo;others say 1750&rdquo;]</span></h2>",

Appointed as court financier to Frederick of Saxony, Lehmann not only helped finance his extravagant lifestyle and military campaigns, but also succeeded in procuring for his royal master the Crown of Poland which in those days was awarded by the Polish nobility to the highest bidder. Lehmann raised the astronomical sum of 10 million thaler and in August 1697, was crowned king of Poland. The king fulfilled Lehmann&rsquo;s three wishes: 1) the rebuilding of the shul in Halberstadt, Lehmann&rsquo;s native town; 2) the reprinting of the Babylonian Talmud of which practically no more copies could be found; and 3) the establishing of the Klaus - in modern terms, a kollel. All three wishes became the greatest blessings of the time. The magnificent shul in Halberstadt in Central Germany stood until 1938 when it was destroyed during Kristallnacht. The Lehmann Talmud was a magnificent edition which was praised profusely by the rabbinical leaders of the time and greatly facilitated the study of Gemara. The Klaus, which imported great Polish Torah scholars to Germany, was a seminal institution of learning which produced many leading rabbinical scholars for Germany and provided a powerful bulwark against the burgeoning Reform movement. (One scholar of the Klaus was Gershon Yehoshafat, who later became rav of Frankfurt on Main. His brother Yissachar Ber Yehoshafat, was a book dealer who decided that conversion to Christianity was necessary to advance. He changed his name to Reuter, was knighted as &ldquo;von Reuter&rdquo; and moved to England where he founded the famous news empire of Reuters.)</span></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Military tribunal opened proceedings against several dozen Jews, including the Duyanevetzer Rav and the Rizhiner Rebbe, who were alleged to know about the murder of two Jewish informers, 1837.

They demanded exorbitant bribes from the Jewish community to keep silent.

Of the 9 who knew of the killings and were involved, 7 received 1000 lashes. (Most of those lashed died on the spot.) Many others were sentenced to life imprisonment or Siberia. Eight people who knew the story but didn&rsquo;t inform the government were given 300-500 lashes.

All the Beit HaMikdash's oil had been defiled by the pagan invaders; and when the Jews sought to light the Beit HaMikdash's Menorah (candelabra), they found only one small cruse of ritually pure olive oil. They lit the Menorah with the one-day supply, which miraculously, burned for eight days, until new, pure oil could be obtained. Also on this day -- 1,100 years earlier -- Moshe Rabbeinu and the Jewish people completed construction of the Mishkan, the portable sanctuary that accompanied them during 40 years of wandering in the desert. The Mishkan was not dedicated, however, for another three months; Our Sages tell us that the day of 25 Kislev was then \"compensated\" 12 centuries later -- when the miracle of Chanukah occurred and the Beit HaMikdash was rededicated.

They did not know that the Israeli leaders had already decided to reject Bernadotte's plans and take the military option. Noted for his negotiation of the release of about 15,000 prisoners from German concentration camps during World War II, he succeeded in achieving a truce in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and laid the groundwork for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The former included the provision of &ldquo;the right of the Arab refugees to return to their homes in Jewish-controlled territory&hellip;&rdquo; The so-called truce was enacted privately, and the secret was publicly exposed in October, only nine days before the U.S. presidential elections, causing President Truman great embarrassment. Truman reacted by making a strongly pro-Zionist declaration, which contributed to the defeat of the Bernadotte plan in the UN during the next two months.&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

He was sent by his venerable father, decades ago, to The Five Towns to bring Torah and Yiddishkeit to that part of New York. Rav Binyomin was well-known for his leadership, his courage, his ahavas haTorah and ahavas Hashem, and his warm and endearing personality, making him beloved by all.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Aside from his illustrious yichus, Rav Binyomin was known for his sterling qualities. He was a talmid chochom who was deeply devoted to limud haTorah. He possessed outstanding middos and was a deeply dedicated and beloved husband, father and grandfather.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Most well-known, though, were his tireless efforts to build Torah in the Five Towns, which today is home to prominent centers of Torah and dozens of shuls, with tens of thousands of frum families. That community owes its very existence to Rav Binyomin, who entered a midbar and worked lesheim Shomayim, without rest, to plant Torah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">One can confidently say that Rav Binyomin was one of the greatest builders of Torah in America of his generation.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin was raised in the town of Tzitivyan, Lithuania, where his father, Rav Yaakov, served as rov. He was three years old when his father assumed that position.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin left home at the young age of 8 to learn in a cheder in the town of Shavel, where he stayed at the home of the dayan of Shavel, Rav Avrohom Yitzchok Nochumofsky. After Shavel, he continued his learning in the Yeshiva Ketana of Kelm, after which I learned in a yeshiva in the city of Rakishok.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Yaakov moved to Toronto from Lita in the late 1930s, as Rav Yaakov assumed a position as rov in the Canadian city. Rav Binyomin and the rest of the family joined him only later on.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In Rav Yaakov&rsquo;s absence, while still in Europe, Rav Binyomin was sent by his uncle from Rakishok to Telshe, where Rav Binyomin learned until he joined his father in North America.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Shortly after arriving in Toronto, Rav Binyomin was sent by his father to learn at Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which was headed by Rav Yaakov&rsquo;s long-time friend, Rav Dovid Leibowitz. He then studied at Yeshiva Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, MD, which was led by his father&rsquo;s cousin, Rav Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">In 1947, Rav Binyomin married his wife, Rebbetzin Tzirel Kamenetzky, one of the seven children of Rav Pinchus Eliyahu Spiegel, the Ostrove-Kalushiner Rebbe in the Bronx, and his Rebbetzin, Basha (nee Burstein).</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin initially served as a rebbi at Yeshiva Toras Chaim in East New York, which was led by Rav Isaac Schmidman. In 1956, at the urging of his father, Rav Binyomin uprooted his family from the thriving community of East New York to move to the small town of Woodmere. Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky told his son, &ldquo;Even if you plant in the wasteland, it will grow.&rdquo; That was the theme of his work in the community.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">People questioned Rav Kamenetsky&rsquo;s decision to give up his stable job as a rebbi to move to a spiritual wasteland, where there was no interest in Torah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin and his rebbetzin faced a challenge ahead of them in growing the community and also in raising their own family al taharas hakodesh.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">There were no kosher facilities to speak of. The Five Towns then was a midbar without a minyan of shomrei Shabbos.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin was undaunted, however.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He opened a yeshiva for boys on Oak Street and Broadway, and a girls&rsquo; school on Pine Street. There was vehement opposition. People worked to shut those mosdos down.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">But Rav Binyomin powered on.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">When Rav Binyomin instituted certain levels of halachic adherence and hashkafah, people told him that those &ldquo;rules&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t work. They told him no one would listen. They told him he was barking up the wrong tree.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">But he knew those doubters were wrong.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Kamenetsky was there to embrace people, bring them into the tent of Torah, and let them know about the beauty of a Torah way of life.

He became the spiritual bedrock of the community.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin ultimately gained the confidence of the community.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin came as a pioneer, introducing Torah Judaism in his own special way, building what became an extraordinary community.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin knew that if he was going to succeed, the community would need yeshivos, schools and shuls. He founded Yeshiva Toras Chaim of South Shore, but he also started the school that became TAG (Torah Academy for Girls), Young Israel of Woodmere, and Rav Dovid Spiegel&rsquo;s Shtiebel in Cedarhurst. His influence and planning started Young Israel of Lawrence/Cedarhurst. Even the institutions that he didn&rsquo;t directly found have his influence embedded in their very existence.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin was interested in helping the yochid and the klal, and no one was too small for him to assist and uplift.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">It was never about him, but about building and increasing the development of Torah. He impacted the lives of thousands, which was why he was held in such great esteem.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He had a dream to do something in an area where it had never been done before.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">And he did it.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He made a difference in the lives of so many people. He was a model for others to learn from in dealing with other people and being a mentch at the highest levels.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">He was dedicated to chinuch with his entire heart and soul, and he gave everything for it.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">His love for every Jewish child was evident always. He believed that every Jewish child deserves and needs a Torah chinuch, whether they could pay tuition or not, and no matter what their background was. And he had a drive to do chesed and help anyone, no matter who they were or where they came from.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">His leadership inspired others to follow him, emulating his love of Torah and his work ethic. His needs were always subordinate to the needs of the community, the needs of the mosdos haTorah, and the needs of fellow Jews.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">It gave Rav Binyomin the greatest satisfaction to see the continuity of Yiddishkeit via mosdos, shuls and other endeavors that he undertook.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">There is almost no one in the Five Towns today who he did not touch, directly or indirectly, because between boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; chinuch, and shuls, everyone has been influenced in some way by Rav Binyomin and his rebbetzin.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Every leader, rov and mosad in the Five Towns has been impacted by this legendary builder of Torah.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin is survived by his children, Mrs. Sarah Knobel, wife of Rav Yitzchok Knobel, rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Gedolah of the Five Towns; Mrs. Esther Wilhelm, wife of Rav Shlomo Wilhelm of Monsey; Mrs. Shani Lefkowitz, wife of Rav Simcha Lefkowitz, rov of Congregation Anshei Chessed in Woodmere, NY; Rav Mordechai Kamenetzky, rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Toras Chaim of South Shore; and Rav Tzvi Kamenetzky of Toronto; and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Rav Binyomin is also survived by his siblings, Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky, Rav Nosson Kamenetsky and Mrs. Rivkah Diskind.

In 1940, the Imrei Emes escaped the Nazis and reached Eretz Yisrael, along with his sons, Rav Yisrael, Rav Simcha Bunim, and Rav Pinchas Menachem. Tragically, Rav Yisrael&rsquo;s wife, daughter, and son were murdered, a fact he didn&rsquo;t learn until 1945. He remarried in 1948, but had no children from his second wife. After his father&rsquo;s petira, Rav Yisrael assumed the mantle of leadership as the 4th Rebbe of Ger. For the next 29 years, he rebuilt Ger and was a major force in the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudas Yisrael. After his passing, Ger was led by his brother, Rav Simcha Bunim, until his petira in 1992. After that, his other brother, Rav Pinchas Menachem led Ger for four years. Since then, Ger has been led by Rav Yaakov Aryeh, the son of Rav Simcha Bunim.&nbsp;<br /><br />Watch this amazing short video about this Rav:</span></h2>\r\n<br /><a href=\"https://yartzeits.com/video9/\"><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://yartzeits.com/watchvideoicon.png\" alt=\"Qries\" width=\"150&quot;\" height=\"70\" /> </a>",

The founder of Gerer dynasty, grandfather of Sfas Emes, Reb Yitzchak Meir was able to trace his lineage back to Rav Meir ben Baruch (the Maharam) of Rottenberg (1215-1293). His mother, Chaya Sarah, was orphaned early in life and was raised by her relative, the Kozhnitzer Maggid. The Maggid had a great influence on Yitzchak Meir during the latter&rsquo;s early years.

He stayed there for the rest twenty years, after which he moved to Monsey, officially &ldquo;retired&rdquo; but working tirelessly for US and world Jewery. His chidushim were printed in his seforim Emes LeYaakov, on Torah and on Shas. As he requested, he was buried in Mt. Judah Cemetery on the Brooklyn/Queens border, since he pointed out that most of his family live in America and would not always be able to travel to his kever in Eretz Yisrael.
